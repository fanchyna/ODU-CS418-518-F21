The modern piano is a highly versatile instrument capable of playing almost anything an orchestra can play. It can sustain pitches in a lyrical fashion, creating all musical styles and moods, with enough volume to be heard through almost any musical ensemble. Broadly defined as a stringed keyboard instrument with a hammer action (as opposed to the jack and quill action of the harpsichord) capable of gradations of soft and loud, the piano became the central instrument of music pedagogy and amateur study. By the end of the nineteenth century, no middle-class household of any stature in Europe or North America was without one. Almost every major Western composer from Mozart onward has played it, many as virtuosi, and the piano repertory\u2014whether solo, chamber, or with orchestra\u2014is at the heart of Western classical professional performance., Cristofori and the First PianofortesThe quiet nature of the piano\u2019s birth around 1700, therefore, comes as something of a surprise. The first true piano was invented almost entirely by one man\u2014Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655\u20131731) of Padua, who had been appointed in 1688 to the Florentine court of Grand Prince Ferdinando de\u2019 Medici to care for its harpsichords and eventually for its entire collection of musical instruments. A 1700 inventory of Medici instruments mentions an \u201carpicimbalo,\u201d i.e., an instrument resembling a harpsichord, \u201cnewly invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori\u201d with hammers and dampers, two keyboards, and a range of four octaves, C\u2013c\u201d\u2019. The poet and journalist Scipione Maffei, in his enthusiastic 1711 description, named Cristofori\u2019s instrument a \u201cgravicembalo col piano, e forte\u201d (harpsichord with soft and loud), the first time it was called by its eventual name, pianoforte. A contemporary inscription by a Florentine court musician, Federigo Meccoli, notes that the \u201carpi cimbalo del piano e\u2019 forte\u201d was first made by Cristofori in 1700, giving us a precise birthdate for the piano., Cristofori was an artful inventor, creating such a sophisticated action for his pianos that, at the instrument\u2019s inception, he solved many of the technical problems that continued to puzzle other piano designers for the next seventy-five years of its evolution. His action was highly complex and thus expensive, causing many of its features to be dropped by subsequent eighteenth-century makers, and then gradually reinvented and reincorporated in later decades. Cristofori\u2019s ingenious innovations included an \u201cescapement\u201d mechanism that enabled the hammer to fall away from the string instantly after striking it, so as not to dampen the string, and allowing the string to be struck harder than on a clavichord; a \u201ccheck\u201d that kept the fast-moving hammer from bouncing back to re-hit the string; a dampening mechanism on a jack to silence the string when not in use; isolating the soundboard from the tension-bearing parts of the case, so that it could vibrate more freely; and employing thicker strings at higher tensions than on a harpsichord., Cristofori\u2019s Surviving PianosThree pianos by Cristofori survive, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1720;\u00a089.4.1219); at the Museo Strumenti Musicali in Rome (1722); and at the Musikinstrumenten-Museum of Leipzig University (1726). The Metropolitan\u2019s Cristofori, the oldest surviving piano, is in a plain wing-shaped case, outwardly resembling a harpsichord. It has a single keyboard and no special stops, in much the same style as Italian harpsichords of the day. (The keyboards of the two other surviving pianos by Cristofori can be shifted slightly so that only one of the two strings of each pitch will be struck, i.e., una corda, thereby quieting the entire instrument.), The sound of the Museum\u2019s 1720 Cristofori differs considerably from the modern grand piano. Its range is narrower\u201454 rather than 88 keys\u2014and its thinner strings and harder hammers give it a timbre closer to a harpsichord than a modern Steinway. Maffei commented that, because of its somewhat muted tone, Cristofori\u2019s piano was best suited for solos or to accompany a voice or single instrument, rather than for larger ensemble work. Indeed, a contemporary harpsichord was a louder and more brilliant instrument, but lacked the ability to respond to the strength of the player\u2019s touch, and so could achieve no significant gradations in dynamic expression. Like the piano, the clavichord (1986.239) is also capable of detailed gradations of loud and soft controlled by the player\u2019s touch, but this intimate stringed instrument is overall so soft that it can barely be heard a few feet away, and so is useless in ensembles or in concert., Cristofori\u2019s invention was initially slow to catch on in Italy, but five pianos by Cristofori or his pupil Giovanni Ferrini were purchased by Queen Maria Barbara de Braganza of Spain, patron and student of Domenico Scarlatti (1685\u20131757). Hundreds of Scarlatti\u2019s more than 500 single-movement keyboard sonatas may have been intended for piano, rather than harpsichord as has long been assumed. The earliest music definitely written and published specifically for the piano were twelve Sonate da cimbalo di piano e forte detto volgarmente di martelletti (Florence, 1732) by Lodovico Giustini (1685\u20131743), dedicated to Don Antonio of Portugal, uncle of Maria Barbara and another student of Scarlatti. The sonatas contain nuanced expressions such as pi\u00f9 forte and pi\u00f9 piano, fine dynamic gradations impossible to execute on a harpsichord., Maffei\u2019s description, which includes a diagram of Cristofori\u2019s action, was translated into German and included in Johann Mattheson\u2019s Critica musica of 1725, where it was probably read by Gottfried Silbermann (1683\u20131753), the important Saxon court organ builder. Based on Cristofori\u2019s design, Silbermann began work on his own pianos in the 1730s. An early model was dismissed by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685\u20131750) as possessing too heavy a touch and too weak a treble. With actual firsthand experience of one of Cristofori\u2019s instruments and subsequent improvements, Silbermann\u2019s pianos were more successful, leading to the purchase of several by Frederick the Great, king of Prussia (r. 1740\u201386). Bach later praised Silbermann\u2019s pianos, going so far as to become a sales agent for his instruments, thereby extending the influence of Cristofori\u2019s creation in central Europe during the years following the Paduan instrument maker\u2019s death., Powers, Wendy. \u201cThe Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655\u20131731).\u201d In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.

According to almost all the posts in question, the message originally came from a \u201cHopi Indian Chief\u201d named \u201cWhite Eagle.\u201d, The message was permeated with the language of New Age spirituality, and typically began by likening \u201cthe moment humanity is going through now\u201d to a \u201cportal\u201d or a \u201chole,\u201d and encouraging readers to engage in \u201cresistance through joy\u201d:, , Despite extensive research, we have not yet been able to find evidence to corroborate the claim that the message originated with a prominent Hopi named \u201cWhite Eagle,\u201d or indeed of any other name., Furthermore, good reasons exist to doubt that widespread attribution, and the earliest versions of the message that we found were published by a Brazilian \u201cmedium\u201d who engages in pseudoscientific practices like \u201creincarnation psychotherapy\u201d and proponents of a Brazilian religious movement \u2014 entirely different cultural contexts to the Hopi tribe in Arizona. For now, we are issuing a rating of \u201cUnproven.\u201d If definitive evidence becomes available, we will update this fact check accordingly., The message was posted and re-posted multiple times in 2020 and 2021, with occasional minor tweaks, but was almost always attributed to \u201cWhite Eagle,\u201d who was typically described as a \u201cHopi Indian Chief.\u201d, In some cases, social media posts featured photographs of what appeared to be an elderly man, while others contained a picture of an elderly woman \u2014 two mutually exclusive claims as to the gender of \u201cWhite Eagle,\u201d and a sign that that attribution might be dubious. In another prominent early version of the message, posted in French on March 28, 2020, the photograph used was actually taken in 1904, meaning it could not possibly show anyone alive in the age of online memes or COVID-19., In June 2020, \u201cBird Clan Messenger\u201d \u2014 a Canadian blog that espouses \u201cindigenous wisdom\u201d and alternative medicine, as well as opposing COVID-19 mitigation measures like lockdowns and vaccine passports \u2014 attributed the \u201cportal and hole\u201d message to Joseph White Eagle, whom the site described as \u201ca Cree spiritual leader and teacher of traditional Native wisdom.\u201d, However, that blog post was later deleted, and Joseph White Eagle posted on Facebook in September 2021, explicitly denying he had authored the message, and adding: \u201cSomebody first gave credit to a fictitious Hopi Chief White Eagle and when they found he does not exist they started giving me credit for this message.\u201d, On March 28, 2020, artist and new-age spiritualist Alex Grey included the message in an Instagram Live broadcast, describing it as \u201cChanneled from White eagle in daime church \/ Message from Caboclo \u00c1guia Branca,\u201d and dating it to March 16, 2020. In this context, \u201cDaime\u201d likely refers to \u201cSanto Daime,\u201d a religious movement which emerged from Brazil in the early 20th century and encompasses elements of various other religions, as well as using the psychedelic drink ayahuasca in rituals.\u00a0, Grey\u2019s reference to \u201cCaboclo \u00c1guia Branca\u201d directed our research to an even earlier social media post containing the message \u2014 a March 19, 2020 Instagram post by Jefferson Orlando, a Brazilian \u201creincarnation pyschotherapist,\u201d which bore the headline \u201cMensagem do Caboclo \u00c1guia Branca\u201d (\u201cmessage from White Eagle.\u201d) When translated from Portuguese, the message was clearly the same one later attributed to a \u201cHopi Chief\u201d named White Eagle, and shared widely in English on social media.\u00a0, , It\u2019s not clear whether \u201cWhite Eagle\u201d is purported to be an actual, living person, a persona adopted by Orlando, or a long-deceased figure whose voice and message Orlando putatively \u201cchanneled.\u201d Snopes asked Orlando for clarification about the origins of the message, but we did not receive a response., Also on March 19, 2020, a popular Facebook page which celebrates the Umbanda faith \u2014 like Santo Daime, Umbanda is a Brazilian religious movement that borrows from other religious practices \u2014 also posted the same message as Orlando, in Portuguese:, , It\u2019s not clear whether \u201cSabedoria de Umbanda\u201d (\u201cUmbanda Wisdom\u201d) or Orlando published their post first, and what the ultimate source of the message was., We were unable to find any reference to the \u201cportal and hole\u201d message dated before March 19, and the \u201cHopi\u201d attribution appears to have only emerged several days later. The earliest available instances of the message emerged from Brazilian religious movements, by way of new-age spirituality and pseudo-scientific paranormal psychology \u2014 vastly different cultural milieus from the traditions of the Hopi people. This strongly suggests the claim that a \u201cHopi Chief White Eagle\u201d authored the message was unfounded.\u00a0, However, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that the March 19 Brazilian posts were, themselves, borrowed from Hopi culture in some way, with the chain of cross-germination no longer available due to social media posts having been deleted.\u00a0, Sources:, \u201cEdward S.

Here is a version of the meme that was posted to Facebook:, , The meme above reads, in part:, So ships are piling up at Long Beach waiting to get unloaded. The port is jammed full of containers with no place to stack more. The liberal media is blaming it on the trucking industry while the nation\u2019s store shelves are becoming bare \u2026 Well there\u2019s more to the story. Could Gavin Newsom and California\u2019s liberal trucking laws be the blame ? \ud83d\ude1b, The NEWS says the California port situation is caused by a driver shortage., Not so fast: It is in part caused by a California Truck Ban which says all trucks must be 2011 or newer and a law called AB 5 which prohibits Owner Operators., The two state laws mentioned are AB5, a 2019 law intended to prevent employers from wrongly classifying workers as contractors, and something called \u201cCalifornia Truck Ban.\u201d The meme also mentions a September 2020 executive order by California Gov. Gavin Newsom that seeks to phase out fuel-burning vehicle engines by 2035 in an effort to combat global warming., The meme is referencing congestion at the ports in San Pedro Bay in Southern California and the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, which collectively handle an estimated 40 percent of the nation\u2019s imports. The back-up is resulting in something of a crisis in shipping delays right before the 2021 winter holidays., The meme above attempts to lay the blame for the crisis at the feet of Newsom, along with California labor and environmental laws. But from a broad perspective, the disruption in the supply chain is a global phenomenon sparked by a confluence of major calamities in 2020 and 2021, including labor shortages, facility closures, and an increased e-commerce demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather, and a massive container ship that had become lodged in the Suez Canal for nearly a week., Here we will look at whether the two laws and executive order mentioned in the meme are to blame for the slowdown at the Southern California ports., There is no law called the \u201cCalifornia Truck Ban.\u201d But from the description above \u2014 that \u201call trucks must be 2011 or newer\u201d \u2014 it appears the post is referencing the California Truck and Bus Regulation. That regulation doesn\u2019t currently block registration of vehicles from the year 2010 and older, however., The Truck and Bus Regulation requires trucks serving the ports to have engines from 2010 or newer as of Jan. 1, 2023. If they don\u2019t, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) would deny registrations to non-compliant vehicles. But the rule, which was adopted in 2008, has taken effect gradually over several years. It\u2019s not new, whereas the situation at the L.A. and Long Beach ports in the fall of 2021 is acute., In an email, Stanley Young, spokesperson for the California Air Resource Board, told Snopes, \u201cAs of 2021 only trucks with engines older than 2005 would have their registration denied.\u201d Young added that 96 percent of the trucks currently serving the major ports in California are already compliant with the regulation., \u201cDespite what you may have heard or read, there is simply no evidence to support any claims that the current congestion at our ports has any connection to the state\u2019s efforts to clean up California\u2019s trucks,\u201d Young stated. \u201cSince trucks at major California ports have been required to have 2007 or newer engines since 2014, and since these engines are legal until at least 2023, it\u2019s impossible that any shortage of vehicles at ports is the result of CARB regulations.\u201d, Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5) is a California law that went into effect in January 2020, although it has faced an onslaught of legal challenges preventing it from being implemented. The law is intended to prevent companies like Uber and Instacart from misclassifying so-called gig workers as independent contractors, rather than employees.\u00a0, Truckers often operate under an \u201cowner-operator\u201d model, in which they own their own vehicles, which they then use to transport goods as contractors for trucking companies. Both the California Trucking Association (CTA) and freight transport company Cal Cartage Express filed legal challenges against AB 5. Cal Cartage lost its case but the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to decide whether to hear a petition by CTA. Until it does, AB 5 remains in limbo for the trucking industry., Matt Schrap, CEO of the the Harbor Trucking Association (which represents drayage truck companies serving the ports of L.A. and Long Beach) said it\u2019s not a shortage of truckers that\u2019s driving the delays, and pointing the finger at AB 5 doesn\u2019t take reality into account., Instead, Schrap said that the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns spurred an explosion of online buying that ramped up sharply during the pandemic lockdowns, and the ports of L.A. and Long Beach don\u2019t have the infrastructure to handle the sudden influx., \u201cIt\u2019s like jamming ten lanes of freeway traffic into five lanes,\u201d Schrap said in a phone interview with Snopes., Currently, the b\u00eate noire for truckers and trucking companies at the ports of L.A. and Long Beach is an excess of empty shipping containers piling up at the ports, which often block truckers from picking up and dropping off cargo., \u201cWe\u2019re struggling with these empty containers,\u201d Schrap said. \u201cThat is really what\u2019s working us over.\u201d, Schrap said he expects that the situation will start to improve, because with the sudden attention on the issue, officials are taking steps to help resolve it, like placing fees on cargo ship companies that leave behind empty containers, and potentially allowing empty container stacking on empty parcels of land at the ports., But these are just Bandaids on a larger problem, which is that the Southern California ports need investment in infrastructure to prevent crises like these, Schrap stressed., \u201cWe\u2019re in this problem because of the underinvestment in the infrastructure that supports the American consumer\u2019s buying habits,\u201d Schrap said. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary solution to a longstanding problem.\u201d, Newsom issued an executive order in September 2020 seeking to phase out gas-burning vehicles by making all new vehicles sold as of 2035 and beyond zero-emission., But Newsom\u2019s order wouldn\u2019t make the current fuel-powered trucks illegal as of 2035. The executive order explicitly states that while California will require new vehicles sold as of 2035 and beyond to be zero-emission, older vehicles will not be illegal to own and operate, and can still be purchased and sold., A news release from the governor\u2019s office announcing the order states, \u201cThe executive order will not prevent Californians from owning gasoline-powered cars or selling them on the used car market.\u201d, Sources:, FreightWaves. \u201cCTA\u2019s Last Hope To Protect California Trucking From AB5: US Supreme Court,\u201d 10 August, 2021, https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/now\/ctas-last-hope-protect-california-184730483.html.\u00a0, Goodman, Peter S., and Erin Schaff. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s Not Sustainable\u2019: What America\u2019s Port Crisis Looks Like Up Close.\u201d The New York Times, 10 Oct. 2021.

EDT, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 With that, I want to welcome the 46th President of the United States, President Joe Biden.\u00a0 (Applause.), So, there\u2019s a lot to get to tonight, and we got a lot of great questions from our audience.\u00a0 We want to get into the details of what you\u2019re calling the Build Back Better plan., Before we get into that though, I just want to know \u2014 there\u2019s been a lot of negotiating going on behind the scenes, as I\u2019m sure you are very involved with.\u00a0 Are you close to a done deal?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No problems.\u00a0 It\u2019s all done.\u00a0 (Laughter.), No, look, Anderson, we\u2019ve been \u2014 I\u2019ve probably spent, well, well over 100 hours.\u00a0 This is a \u2014 this is a big deal.\u00a0 We\u2019re both have \u2014 we have two plans: one is the infrastructure plan \u2014 roads, highways, bridges, buses, trains, et cetera \u2014 and the other one is what I call the \u201ccare economy\u201d.\u00a0 It has a lot of money in there for environmental remediation as well as care economy.\u00a0 For example, you know, we want to get the economy moving, but millions of women can\u2019t go to work because they don\u2019t have any childcare.\u00a0 That kind of thing., So, there\u2019s a lot of pieces in there.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot that people don\u2019t understand.\u00a0 And, by the way, all of it\u2019s paid for \u2014 every single penny.\u00a0 It\u2019s not going to raise one single cent (inaudible).\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get into a lot \u2014 a lot of those details.\u00a0 Just, though, are you close to a deal?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think so.\u00a0 You know, look, I\u2019ve been \u2014 I was a senator for 370 years.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I was never \u2014 I was relatively good at putting together deals., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Is this the toughest deal you\u2019ve worked on?\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 I think banning assault weapons was the toughest deal I worked on \u2014 and succeeded.\u00a0 (Applause.), MR. COOPER:\u00a0 You\u2019re flying \u2014 you\u2019re flying to Europe, I think, in eight days., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Do you think you\u2019ll have a deal by the time you get on Air Force One in eight days?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, look, you know, it\u2019s like my asking you, \u201cAre you sure your next show is going to be a success?\u201d\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 You know., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 (Laughter.), THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, you\u2019re more confident than I am.\u00a0 Look \u2014 hey, look, it\u2019s all about compromise.\u00a0 You know, \u201ccompromise\u201d has become a dirty word, but it\u2019s \u2014 bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible.\u00a0, When I ran for the presidency, I said I\u2019m running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul and decency in the country; two, to build the middle class and the working class so they were \u2014 we build from the middle out; and three, to actually unite the country.\u00a0 And everybody has been saying, \u201cWell, that\u2019s crazy.\u00a0 You can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u00a0 If we can\u2019t eventually unite this country, we\u2019re in deep trouble., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Bottom line: Do you think you will get a deal?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I do think I\u2019ll get a deal., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 All right, let\u2019s get some \u2014 let\u2019s go to the audience.\u00a0 This is Nicholas Vaught.\u00a0 He\u2019s the coordinator at the Applied Liberal Studies Program at Morgan State University.\u00a0 He\u2019s a Democrat.\u00a0, Nicholas, your question., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Morgan State., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Morgan State., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 All right, man.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken there., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, my wife and I have two young boys, Arthur and Teddy.\u00a0 However, the cost of childcare is nearly double our mortgage.\u00a0 We want to have more children, but even though we earn a good salary now, childcare is so expensive.\u00a0 So how will this new infrastructure plan help middle-class families pay for childcare?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, let me ask you: Do you have \u2014 how old are your kids?, Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three and a half and six months old.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 God love you.\u00a0 (Laughter.), Well, look, there\u2019s two pieces.\u00a0 There\u2019s the childcare \u2014 having someone take care of your child while you are working, while you and your wife are working.\u00a0 Under this proposal I have, no one will have to pay \u2014 unless you\u2019re making more than \u2014 individually, you\u2019re each making \u2014 making over 300 grand \u2013$150,000 apiece., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re educators.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, God.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And, by the way, I\u2019m married to one: Dr. Biden \u2014 right here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0, So \u2014 so you will not have to pay more than 7 percent of your income for childcare \u2014 7 percent.\u00a0 And the way we do that is we provide for the ability to have childcare centers funded.\u00a0 The money won\u2019t even go \u2014 you don\u2019t \u2014 the \u2014 figure your income; you get 7 percent with the total cost., But there\u2019s another piece here: You now are qualified to be able to have a Child Tax Credit.\u00a0 It used to be that when you \u2014 you know, when you \u2014 if you were \u2014 had enough money to pay significant taxes, you could write off 2,000 bucks for every child you had and reduce it from your taxes.\u00a0 But if you were making 60,000 bucks a year and you didn\u2019t have that much to write off, you didn\u2019t get anything., Well, I call this a tax break for middle-class people.\u00a0 If you\u2019re making in the $150,000 range right now, you\u2019re in a situation where you can get, if you have a child under 7, $350; if you have a child over 7, between 7 and 17, you can get $300.\u00a0 And you get a direct payment.\u00a0 You \u2014 the IRS sends you money., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Joe Manchin wants a work requirement with your enhanced tax credit for kids.\u00a0 Is that something you would support?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the deal: All these people are working anyway.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0, And, by the way, you know, why should somebody who is not working and has \u2014 you know, makes \u2014 has a million-dollar trust fund, why should they get the benefit, and someone making 60 grand and not working, but staying home, why should they not get anything?\u00a0 I don\u2019t get that., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 You\u2019re also proposing, for the first time ever, federal paid parental leave.\u00a0 And \u2014 (applause) \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 That\u2019s a different issue.\u00a0 Yeah., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 A different issue.\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 But this is \u2014 but this is in your proposal.\u00a0 How much time off would parents actually get under your proposal?\u00a0 Because at one point, you talked about 12 weeks.\u00a0 Now there\u2019s reports it\u2019s down to maybe four weeks., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, it is down to four weeks.\u00a0 And the reason it\u2019s down to 4 weeks is I can\u2019t get 12 weeks.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0, And \u2014 but, look, here\u2019s the deal, guys: How many people do you know \u2014 not a joke \u2014 or maybe yourself \u2014 have had a circumstance where you are working like the devil, you\u2019re making 7 bucks an hour, 15 bucks an hour, or 20 bucks an hour, and you have a child that\u2019s sick at home \u2014 or you have a mother or a father, husband and wife, son or daughter, and you need to stay home to help them?\u00a0, We\u2019re one of the few industrial countries in the world that doesn\u2019t have paid leave \u2014 so that when you stay home to help that person, to take care of that person, you\u2019re still getting your pay.\u00a0 And it does not hurt the business at all.\u00a0 The business isn\u2019t paying for it; the federal government is paying for it.\u00a0 It\u2019s a little bit like, as I said, a tax cut for people who are not able to otherwise take care of their families., And, look, I\u2019m looking out here, and a lot of you are part of that sandwich generation: You have young kids, and you have aging parents.\u00a0 And one of the things all the polling data shows, Anderson, is people are more concerned about taking care of the elderly, because they don\u2019t know what to do, than they are even their children., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 I want to talk about this.\u00a0 I want you to meet Vanessa Antrum from Bowie, Maryland.\u00a0 She\u2019s retired.\u00a0 She\u2019s a caregiver for her elderly parents., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 God love you., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 She\u2019s a Democrat.\u00a0, Vanessa, your question., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Mr. President, my parents have been married for 73 years and both are dealing \u2014 (applause) \u2014 yes.\u00a0 Both of them are dealing with dementia.\u00a0 My father, who was a veteran, is completely bedridden, and my mom is experiencing issues with walking., I have found the process for me to provide care for them in my home very hard.\u00a0 They have worked all their life only for me to experience a lot of red tape to provide support \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Bingo., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 in a loving home environment.\u00a0 What is being done to support the elderly, especially for a middle-class family like mine?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, first of all \u2014 (applause) \u2014 if my mom were here, she\u2019d say you\u2019re a good daughter, number one., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Number two, I was in a situation like you, where I was making more money \u2014 I was making $42,000 a year as a senator at the time, although I was listed the poorest man in the Senate for 36 years, but \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I still made more money than most people because Senate salaries kept going up.\u00a0, What happened was my \u2014 my dad got sick, and he was in hospice, so Jill and I took my dad home and we took care of him in our house.\u00a0 But we were lucky because we had the ability to have \u2014 I have a sister who is an angel and a brother who\u2019s a wonderful guy, and we all took turns in our house taking care of them.\u00a0, But here\u2019s the deal: Right now, under Medicaid, there are 860,000 \u2014 I think it\u2019s 860- \u2014 don\u2019t hold me to the exact number, but it\u2019s over 800,000 \u2014 who qualify for home healthcare aid for their parents, but there\u2019s no money there.\u00a0 There\u2019s no money there., So what we do is we provide the funding for Medicaid to allow you to be able to keep \u2014 if your parents had their home \u2014 keeping them in their home if you wanted, or get help in your home with homecare from professionals providing \u2014 helping you take care of them \u2014 helping you take care of them., And in many cases where you\u2019re not taking care of them in your own home and they\u2019re staying \u2014 and they\u2019re staying in their home, you\u2019re going to be able to have the ability to have someone come in and make their meals for them.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have to be there 24\/7.\u00a0, So, there\u2019s a lot of things we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 In addition to the process, we\u2019re going to be able to train up those homecare workers who are usually minority women, women of color, as well as immigrants.\u00a0 And they have the capacity to learn more as they go along, to move to the point where they can become practical nurses and things like that.\u00a0, So, it makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s cheaper \u2014 cheaper than it is to not do it.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 One of the other things that Democrats are looking to do is to expand Medicare to include dental, vision, and hearing as well.\u00a0 Given all the negotiations that are going on, will all three of those still be covered?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s a reach.\u00a0 And the reason why it\u2019s a reach \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 I think it\u2019s a good idea, and it\u2019s not that costly in relative terms, especially if we allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices.\u00a0, But here\u2019s the thing: Mr. Manchin is \u2014 is opposed to that, as is \u2014 I think Senator Sinema is as well., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Opposed to all of them?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Opposed to all three.\u00a0 Because they don\u2019t want \u2014 he says he doesn\u2019t want to further burden Medicare so that \u2014 because it will run out of its ability to maintain itself in X number of years.\u00a0 There\u2019s ways to fix that, but he\u2019s not interested in that part either.\u00a0 (Laughter.), But, look, Joe \u2014 Joe is not a bad guy.\u00a0 He\u2019s a friend.\u00a0 And he\u2019s always, at the end of the day, come around and voted for it., But \u2014 but here\u2019s the point: We\u2019re in a situation now where if you are in a circumstance that you\u2019re not able to provide \u2014 let me cut to the chase; I\u2019m taking too long.\u00a0 (Laughter.), One of the things we were able to do in the meantime is \u2014 the most expensive of these things would be dental.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Now, we\u2019re talking about \u2014 and I don\u2019t have a deal on it yet \u2014 maybe getting an $800 voucher from Medicare for dental work that you may need., And the hearing is a very important thing because \u2014 as Kyrsten Sinema, who supports this, points out \u2014 hearing is directly related to dementia.\u00a0 When you can\u2019t hear, you have a problem, and it impacts on dementia., So, we\u2019re able to, I \u2014 and it\u2019s cheaper to be able to take care of hearing.\u00a0 But I think I\u2019ve been able to take care of that without changing Medicare, because what\u2019s happening is now you have these hearing aid companies; you no longer are going to have to go to the doctor and spend five grand and get an app- \u2014 you can go buy at Walgreens, and buy over-the-counter hearing aids.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0, So \u2014 the harder one, though, is we \u2014 we haven\u2019t gotten a consensus yet on how to deal with seeing, glasses.\u00a0 And \u2014 but that\u2019s \u2014 so \u201cit\u2019s not done yet\u201d is the answer.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 I want to get another question in.\u00a0 This is Ben Frederick.\u00a0 Ben is a realtor, a lifelong resident of Baltimore.\u00a0 He\u2019s an independent.\u00a0 Serves on the Maryland Multi-Housing Association., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 By the way, Ben, the Bidens all hail from Baltimore, beginning in 1850.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how the hell they kicked me out, but I\u2019m \u2014 (laughter)., MR COOPER:\u00a0 Ben, what\u2019s your question?, Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IRS data shows that the top 5 percent of income earners pays 60 percent of the income taxes in this country.\u00a0 I hear you repeatedly say that the wealthy are not paying their fair share of income taxes.\u00a0 What is the percentage of income that you believe is fair?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think what\u2019s fair is that \u2014 this present tax code, the highest tax rate is 35 percent, number one.\u00a0 Okay?, Number two, you\u2019re in a circumstance where corporate America is not paying their fair share.\u00a0 And I come from the corporate state of the world: Delaware.\u00a0 More corporations in Delaware than every other state in the union combined.\u00a0 Okay?, Now, here\u2019s the deal though: You have 55 corporations, for example, in the United States of America making over $40 billion, who don\u2019t pay a cent.\u00a0 Not a single little red cent.\u00a0, Now, I don\u2019t care \u2014 I\u2019m a capitalist.\u00a0 I hope you can be a millionaire or a billionaire.\u00a0 I \u2014 not a problem.\u00a0 But at least pay your fair share.\u00a0 Chip in a little bit., And so \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Well, let me \u2014 let me follow up, because Kyrsten Sinema, who you mentioned \u2014 Senator Sinema is opposed to any tax rate hikes for corporations and for high earners.\u00a0 Speaker Pelosi suggested today she could accept that., The question is: A, would you accept that \u2014 no rate hikes \u2014 tax rate hikes for corporations or high earners?\u00a0 And if so, how would you pay for this plan otherwise?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Because you don\u2019t have \u2014 look, here\u2019s the deal: The tax rate \u2014 the corporate tax rate was 35 points-some \u2014 37 percent.\u00a0 Barack and I thought it should come down.\u00a0 We thought it should come down to 28 percent.\u00a0, In the process, it came down to 21 percent under Trump, which even the corporate leaders \u2014 and you know if you\u2019re in real estate \u2014 major real estate.\u00a0 Ask them.\u00a0 They know they should be paying a little more than 21 percent.\u00a0 Because the idea that if you\u2019re a schoolteacher and a firefighter, you\u2019re paying at a higher tax rate than they are, as a percentage of your taxes., But here\u2019s the deal: I believe that we can do the \u2014 we can pay for this whole thing \u2014 I have it written on a card here, but I won\u2019t bore you with the detail.\u00a0 But, for example, if you in fact made sure that you paid a minimum 15 percent \u2014 minimum 15 percent \u2014 if you\u2019re paying nothing \u2014 minimum 15 \u2014 that\u2019s almost \u2014 that\u2019s over almost $400 billion over 10 years., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 So you would be willing to go along with what Senator Sinema and, it seems like, Speaker Pelosi is willing to consider: no tax hike for corporations or for high-earning individuals?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Here\u2019s what I\u2019m willing to do: I\u2019m willing to make sure that we pay for everything without anyone making less than $400,000 paying a single cent more in taxes.\u00a0 That\u2019s my objective., And so, there\u2019s ways to do that.\u00a0 For example \u2014 you covered it on your show \u2014 the minimum international tax at 15 percent., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 But no rate \u2014 actual rate hikes?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to get to vote.\u00a0 Look \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 when you\u2019re in the United States Senate and you\u2019re President of the United States and you have 50 Democrats,\u00a0every one is a President.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Every single one.\u00a0 So, you got to work things out.\u00a0, But where I am is, I\u2019m hearing now \u2014 I\u2019ll turn on the news and I\u2019ll hear that \u201cBiden\u2019s caved on such and\u2026\u201d\u00a0, Look, Biden has a simple proposition.\u00a0 Biden is going to get \u2014 all the elements of these two bills have profound impact on economic growth; reduce, not increase, inflation; don\u2019t add a penny to the debt; as well as grow the economy.\u00a0 According \u2014 I had 17 Nobel laureates in economics sent me a letter recently saying that my proposals would actually reduce inflation, diminish (inaudible)., But here\u2019s the point.\u00a0 The point of it all is that I\u2019m prepared \u2014 I can\u2019t think of anything that was consequential and changing the circumstance for the middle class and working class in America that came as a consequence of a single piece of legislation.\u00a0, I got a portrait of Roosevelt in my office.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Social Security is not anything like it is today when he passed it.\u00a0 It evolved.\u00a0 It moved.\u00a0 It grew.\u00a0, So I\u2019m prepared to do the things that can get done now that can begin to change the lives of ordinary Americans to give them a fighting chance and come back and try to get others later., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about another one of those things.\u00a0 This is Sondra Guttman, an English professor at \u2014 (applause) \u2014 at Loyola University \u2014 also a Democrat.\u00a0, Sondra, what\u2019s your question?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And, by the way, you got another English professor who teaches writing here.\u00a0 (Laughter.), Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you for taking my question, Mr. President.\u00a0 We\u2019ve heard in the news that the proposal for two years of free community college may be cut from your economic package.\u00a0 An educated citizenry is absolutely crucial to solving complex problems like climate change \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and the systematic inequities in this country.\u00a0 We hope that this is not cut from the package, but if it is, what can you do to ensure that all Americans can get the education that they need to face these issues?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, first of all, Professor, you made a very profound point, and I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not being sarcastic \u2014 and that is \u2014 and Jill uses a slightly different phrase: \u201cAny country that out-educates us will out-compete us.\u201d\u00a0 Any country that out educates will out- \u2014 out-educates will out-compete us.\u00a0, You have the vast majority \u2014 of the 37 major cor- \u2014 countries in the world \u2014 economies \u2014 we rank 35 in our investment in education.\u00a0 We\u2019re in a situation where if you \u2014 if you think about it, when we \u2014 what caused us to move ahead and dominate the 20th century: In the late 1900s \u2014 in the early 1900s, late 1890s, we came up \u2014 we said, 12 years of free education.\u00a0 That was revolutionary at the time.\u00a0 I mean, seriously.\u00a0, Now, if we were sitting down today and saying, \u201cOh, we got to put together an education system,\u201d raise your hand if anybody thinks 12 years is enough to compete in the 21st century?\u00a0, So, that\u2019s why what I propose is: free child \u2014 free school \u2014 free school for every three- and four-year-old in America, no matter what their background., All the data shows that no matter what home they come from, they increase exponentially their prospects of succeeding all the way through 12 years of school.\u00a0 You know \u2014 you know all the statistics.\u00a0, The statistics go that if you come from a home where there\u2019s no books in the home and a single mom or a single dad, they don\u2019t \u2014 they\u2019re not well educated, they don\u2019t talk a lot, the kid from the middle class \u2014 average middle-class home versus that home will go to school having heard 1 million more words spoken than the child who didn\u2019t.\u00a0 A gigantic disadvantage.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Mr. President, the question was on the \u2014 the \u2014 on community colleges \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I know.\u00a0 I \u2014\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 \u2014 which \u2014 which was a big campaign promise that you made.\u00a0 You talked about that a lot on \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, I \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 \u2014 the campaign trail., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, and I\u2019m going to get it done.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be sleeping alone for a long time.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0, But here\u2019s the deal: So far, Mr. Manchin and one other person has indicated they will not support free community college.\u00a0 So, what I\u2019ve \u2014 what I think we can get done is we can significantly increase the amount of money by 500 bucks a payment for Pell Grants.\u00a0 And Pell Grants are available, and they can apply for up to 30 percent of the cost of community college and\/or \u2014 and\/or college help tuition.\u00a0, So, it\u2019s not going to get us there.\u00a0 It\u2019s not going to get us the whole thing, but it is a start.\u00a0, I\u2019m convinced \u2014 absolutely, positively convinced that we\u2019re going to be able to \u2014 and, by the way, we have in the law \u2014 in the legislation, money for community colleges that deal with \u2014 dealing with apprenticeships, dealing with teaching people particular skills that are not getting \u2014 will not get you a two-year degree but will teach you the skill.\u00a0, So, I think we can get all of that done this time out.\u00a0, But I promise you \u2014 I guarantee you, we\u2019re going to get free community college in the next several years and across the board.\u00a0 (Applause.), MR. COOPER:\u00a0 What was that conversation when you realized you weren\u2019t able \u2014 going to be able to get it in this bill at this time, and you had dinner with Dr. Biden that night, what was that conversation like?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 How did you break that news?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, the White House has a lot of bedrooms.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And she went like this.\u00a0 (Points.)\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cDown the hall.\u201d, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 All right., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, look, it really makes a gigantic difference.\u00a0 And think of this: You have more countries in the world with \u2014 having \u2014 providing college \u2014 I mean, providing professional education beyond 12 years.\u00a0 We rank like, I think it\u2019s \u2014 don\u2019t hold me to the number \u2014 I think it\u2019s 16 or 17 in the world \u2014 the United States of America, for God\u2019s sake., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 I want \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 This is about putting us in the game.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 This is John Meche.\u00a0 He\u2019s a doctoral candidate at Morgan State University and an independent.\u00a0 John, welcome.\u00a0 What\u2019s your question?\u00a0 (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Where \u2014 where are you?, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Morgan State.\u00a0, Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Morgan State.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT: \u00a0I know all these Morgan men, man.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0, I\u2019ve spoken there a couple times.\u00a0 And, by the way, the guy who runs my operation is a \u2014 anyway \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I \u2014 I keep talking about Delaware State, but they keep saying about Morgan State, you know?, Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Morgan State.\u00a0, President Biden, I had so much faith in your election win, but based on history, the bipartisan efforts of the Democratic Party are held hostage by rogue moderates and Republicans.\u00a0 Why not do like the Republicans and usher through the Democratic agenda?\u00a0 (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, two reasons.\u00a0 If you notice, the Republicans haven\u2019t passed a single, solitary thing.\u00a0 Zero.\u00a0 So, ushering through their agenda \u2014 their agenda right now is just \u201cstop Biden.\u201d\u00a0 Although, I shouldn\u2019t make it so personal.\u00a0 \u201cStop my administration\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s what the agenda is.\u00a0 It\u2019s much easier to stop something than to start something.\u00a0, And look, what we did is, when I wrote \u2014 I\u2019m going to back up just a second.\u00a0 I apologize.\u00a0 I wrote \u2014 I personally \u2014 during the campaign, before I got elected, I wrote the infrastructure bill relating to what we do to highways and all that kind of thing.\u00a0 Hard \u2014 hard data.\u00a0 And I wrote the \u2014 what they call \u2014 what\u2019s now called the \u201ccare economy\u201d piece and has a gigantic piece of environmental pieces in it too.\u00a0, And I went before the joint session of Congress, and I laid out exactly what I was for.\u00a0 And so, I made it clear what I was for.\u00a0 Initially what happened was, I got no support for anything from our Republican friends.\u00a0 And then they said, \u201cMaybe we can work out a bipartisan deal on infrastructure.\u201d\u00a0 And we did.\u00a0 We worked on it.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t give me everything I wanted.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t have as much money in there for the environment, although it has tens of billions of dollars in there, but didn\u2019t have what I wanted in it.\u00a0 But we made a bipartisan deal.\u00a0, Now, what\u2019s coming along is this reconciliation \u2014 they call it a fancy word \u2014 for the other pieces that have the childcare pieces, have the economy that relates to allowing people to \u2014 women to go back to work.\u00a0 It has about $450 billion for environmental remediation, and so on.\u00a0, And that\u2019s the one that is the issue.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Well, let me \u2014 let me ask you \u2014 just getting to \u2014 to his question: You \u2014 we\u2019ve talked a lot about Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema.\u00a0 You seem relatively confident you can kind of get Senator Manchin on board.\u00a0, There\u2019s a lot of Democrats in the House and Senate who are confused about where Senator Sinema actually stands on things.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I know she\u2019s been negotiating directly with you and the White House.\u00a0 What is your read on her?\u00a0, And I \u2014 obviously, you need her to remain positive in your direction, so I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to say.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But what is your read on \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0\u00a0No \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Do you know where she stands?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 First of all, she\u2019s smart as the devil, number one.\u00a0 Number two, she\u2019s very supportive of the environmental agenda in my legislation \u2014 very supportive., She\u2019s supportive of all \u2014 almost all the things I mentioned, relating to everything from family care to all \u2014 to all those issues., Where she\u2019s not supportive is she says she will not raise a single penny in taxes on the corporate side and\/or on wealthy people.\u00a0 Period., And so, that\u2019s where it sort of breaks down, and there\u2019s a few other issues it breaks down on.\u00a0 But what we\u2019re trying to do is reach a point here where I\u2019m able to present to the Senate \u2014 they\u2019re able to vote on \u2014 and the House \u2014 a serious, serious piece of legislation that changes the dynamic for working-class folks in America and middle-class folks, and begins to have the very wealthy and corporations just begin to pay their fair share \u2014 not a lot., How we get there \u2014 we\u2019re down to four or five issues, which I\u2019m not going to negotiate on national television, as you might guess., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 We\u2019d be interested \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no, no., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 \u2014 in hearing them, if you want.\u00a0 (Laughter.), THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no, no.\u00a0 I know.\u00a0 But, all kidding aside, I think we can get there., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 You talked about the environmental piece.\u00a0 You said Senator Sinema is on board with that.\u00a0 Certainly, Senator Manchin is not.\u00a0 It gets to our next question.\u00a0, This is from Kobi Khong.\u00a0 He\u2019s originally from Anaheim, California.\u00a0 He\u2019s a Sophomore Class President at Johns Hopkins University, a Democrat.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0, Kobi, what\u2019s your question?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Mr. President., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the largest issues that people have trouble comprehending the severity of is climate change.\u00a0 Many legislators and politicians today are lenient, as they won\u2019t have to live with the future effects.\u00a0 Without the legislative support for the climate aspects of your budget proposal and the earth rapidly approaching the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5 degrees limit, what other backup plans do you have to ensure a future for the next generations?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s \u2014 (applause).\u00a0 Mr. President, you got it right.\u00a0 The existential threat to humanity is climate change.\u00a0 And when President Trump pulled out of the Paris Accord \u2014 which, when I was with the Obama administration, we helped negotiate \u2014 the agreement was that we could not \u2014 if we reached beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in temperature, we\u2019re gone.\u00a0 Not a joke.\u00a0 Not a joke., And so, we decided that \u2014 he pulled out.\u00a0 First thing I committed to do is rejoin that accord, number one.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0, But number two \u2014 number two: What you have to do is you look at \u2014 there\u2019s multiple ways in which we can deal with climate.\u00a0 I\u2019m going off to COP26 in Scotland, and \u2014 in, I don\u2019t know, I guess it\u2019s two weeks or a week.\u00a0 I \u2014 I\u2019m losing track of time., And \u2014 and I\u2019m presenting a commitment to the world that we will, in fact, get to net-zero emissions on electric power by 2035 and net-zero emissions across the board by 2050 or before.\u00a0 But we have to do so much between now and 2030 to demonstrate what we\u2019re going to \u2014 that we\u2019re going to do., So, let me give you a couple examples., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Let me just follow up, though, very quickly on that, because the \u2014 the key climate provision that was in the Build Back Better plan, as you call it \u2014 the Clean Electricity Performance Program \u2014 that\u2019s been dropped now from this spending bill.\u00a0 Reported \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, it hasn\u2019t., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 It has not?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, it ha- \u2014 look \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 But Senator Manchin is opposed to that., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He\u2019s opposed to it.\u00a0 But here\u2019s the deal: That is only one of well over \u2014 well over a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of expenditures for climate change.\u00a0 It\u2019s $150 billion.\u00a0 It\u2019s important.\u00a0, And what it says is that if, in fact, the utility doesn\u2019t pull back and continue to reduce the amount of carbon that they admit, that what will happen is they will end up paying a penalty.\u00a0 And so, there\u2019s a penalty incurred., Joe Manchin\u2019s argument is: Look, we still have coal in my state.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to eliminate it eventually.\u00a0 We know it\u2019s going away.\u00a0 We know it\u2019s going to be gone.\u00a0 But don\u2019t rush it so fast that my people don\u2019t have anything to do., I think that\u2019s not what we should be doing, but the fact of the matter is we can take that $150 billion, add it to the $320 billion that\u2019s in the \u2014 in the law now that he\u2019s prepared to support for tax incentives \u2014 tax incentives to have people act in a way that they\u2019re going to be able to do the things that need to be do from \u2014, For example, if you\u2019re \u2014 if you \u2014 if you got windows that are the, you know, the wind is blowing through, you get an incentive to put new windows in your home.\u00a0 You get \u2014 you \u2014 help get it paid., We\u2019re going to significantly reduce the amount \u2014 the cost of solar panels on your roof.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to continually \u2014 and, for example, there\u2019s new battery technologies that are being \u2014 I went out in Silicon Valley; there\u2019s a battery that\u2019s about that wide and about that thick.\u00a0 If you have solar power, you put that in your basement and the sun doesn\u2019t shine for seven days, you still have all the power you need., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 But the concession has been agreed to for Senator Manchin \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no, no., MR. COOPER: \u2014 about coal in his state \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Is that true?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Nothing has been formally agreed to.\u00a0 The concession has been \u2014 the negotiation is: I\u2019ve been saying to Joe, \u201cLook, I\u2019ll take \u2014 if we don\u2019t do it in terms of the \u2014 the electric grid piece, what we\u2019ll do is \u2014 give me that $150 billion.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to add it to be able to do other things that allow me to do things that don\u2019t directly affect the electric grid in the way that there\u2019s a penalty, but allow me to spend the money to set new technologies in place.\u201d, For example, we can save significant amounts of money and, as a consequence of that, significant amounts of energy, if, in fact, we are able to put the high-tension wires underground.\u00a0 It costs a hell of a lot more to do it.\u00a0 It creates real good jobs; it creates a hell of a lot more to do it.\u00a0 But, in fact, it would do a lot to keep things from happening that are dangerous.\u00a0 Half the forest fires out West are those towers coming down, setting fires, et cetera., So, there\u2019s a lot of things Joe is open to my convincing him that I can use it to increase environmental progress without it being that particular deal., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 We\u2019re going to take a quick break.\u00a0 When we get back, we got a lot more questions for President Biden.\u00a0 (Applause.), (Commercial break.), MR. COOPER:\u00a0 And welcome back.\u00a0 We are live at a CNN Town Hall event in Baltimore, Maryland, with President Joe Biden., So, before we get to our next question, I want to just bring up the current labor market shortages.\u00a0 Millions of jobs are unfilled, businesses are struggling to meet demand.\u00a0 Is there anything you can do to either encourage people to go back to work or make jobs more attractive that they want to go back to work?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, so, first \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Is there a role for the federal government?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 First of all, we\u2019ve created more jobs in the first eight months of my administration than any President in American history \u2014 total number of jobs created.\u00a0, But the problem for the people not going back to work is twofold.\u00a0 Number one, they\u2019re reluctant to go back to work because they\u2019re afraid of COVID \u2014 many of them.\u00a0 So they don\u2019t want to go back and they don\u2019t want to be exposed to either the customers because they\u2019re not required to wear masks or not required to have shots, or they don\u2019t want to go back because they\u2019re not sure of the people waiting on them and they \u2014 at the table, or the people coming up in the food market.\u00a0 So, a lot of it has to do with COVID.\u00a0 Number one.\u00a0, Number two \u2014 and that\u2019s why, you know, we were able to go from \u2014 when I first got elected \u2014 when I first was elected, there were only 2 million people who had COVID shots in the United States of America \u2014 had the vaccine.\u00a0 Now we got 190 million, because I went out and bought everything I could do \u2014 and buy in sight, and it worked.\u00a0 (Applause.), But here\u2019s the deal: The second thing \u2014 the second thing that has happened, Anderson, is that people are now using this as an opportunity to say, \u201cWait a minute, do I want to go back to that $7-an-hour job?\u201d\u00a0, I won\u2019t name the particular restaurant chain, but they found out when they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t hire anybody.\u00a0 When they found out, they started to pay 20 bucks an hour, everybody wanted to go back to work.\u00a0 Not a joke.\u00a0, So what you see is wages are actually up for those who are working, because for the first time in a long time, employees are able to bargain.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re the boss?\u00a0 You want me to work for you?\u00a0 What are you going to pay me?\u00a0 How are you going to do it?\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m not being facetious.\u00a0, The third thing that\u2019s out there is there\u2019s a circumstance that exists where people are really worried about what they\u2019re going to do \u2014 I mean, how \u2014 how can I say this?\u00a0, How many people do you know \u2014 and maybe some in this audience \u2014 who, because of what you\u2019ve been through \u2014 a loss of a husband, wife, brother, mother, father, son, whatever \u2014 or you\u2019ve had something that\u2019s really impacted you with COVID that you really find yourself just down?\u00a0 I mean just down.\u00a0 And so, there\u2019s a lot of people who are just down.\u00a0 They\u2019re not sure how to get back in the game.\u00a0 They\u2019re not sure whether they want to get back in the game., Think of this: If you\u2019re graduating from Morgan State, okay?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Well, guess what?\u00a0 You didn\u2019t have those great dances the last four years that you\u2019d had before you went out at Morgan.\u00a0 No, I\u2019m not joking.\u00a0 Graduated from high school, you don\u2019t have your prom, you don\u2019t have your graduation, you don\u2019t have the thing \u2014 all the things that matter to people that go into things they look forward to.\u00a0 So, a lot of it has to do with us getting back on our feet and getting back on our feet in terms of our attitudes about what the future looks like for us., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 What do you say to someone who\u2019s down?\u00a0 Because \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What I say \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of people watching tonight who are.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, there are.\u00a0 And I tell you what: There\u2019s plenty of help.\u00a0 Look, being down, having some problem in terms of needing some \u2014 some advice \u2014 if you have a broken spirit, it\u2019s no different than a broken arm.\u00a0 You shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of it.\u00a0 You should seek the help.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of people who can help.\u00a0 (Applause.), And \u2014 but I really mean it.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the whole problem, but I\u2019m saying it is an element in terms of attitude about people \u2014 what they want.\u00a0, Look, how often I get asked the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s Christmas going to be like?\u00a0 How about Thanksgiving?\u00a0 Is it going to be okay?\u00a0 I mean, what\u2019s going to happen?\u00a0 I mean, how will I be able to buy gifts for my kids?\u201d\u00a0 How \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of anxiety people have.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I want to ask a question along the lines of concern about Christmas and holidays and the supply chain.\u00a0, Anna Hirsch is here, a student at Loyola University, who is originally from Connecticut.\u00a0 She\u2019s a Democrat.\u00a0 Anna, what\u2019s your question?\u00a0 (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, Anna., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Biden, growing up in a small town, I\u2019ve been surrounded by small-business owners, including my mom who owns her own interior design business.\u00a0 With the current supply chain crisis, small businesses are in jeopardy of not being able to get products that they need \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They are., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 because priority is given to large businesses.\u00a0 Does your administration have any policies or plans in place to aid the current supply chain problem and\/or to help small businesses that are affected by this?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes on both.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Here \u2014 but you \u2014 but you have it exactly right.\u00a0, We have a significant supply chain problem.\u00a0 In the Obama-Biden administration, all of American business \u2014 and it made sense \u2014 it was just on time.\u00a0 You wanted to make sure that you didn\u2019t waste any money and\/or time between producing whatever you\u2019re producing and having it done.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t \u2014 so that\u2019s how you saved money.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t buy the material six months ahead of time and then keep it in your inventory and then move it.\u00a0 It was on time.\u00a0, Now, that\u2019s a big problem.\u00a0 You can\u2019t \u2014 people can\u2019t do it.\u00a0 They want to get out ahead.\u00a0 What I\u2019ve recently done \u2014 and people said \u2014 doubted we could get it done.\u00a0 I was able to go to the private por- \u2014 40 percent of all products coming into the United States of America on the West Coast go through Los Angeles and \u2014 and \u2014 oh, what am I doing here?, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Is it Long Beach or \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Long Beach.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0, And I know both the mayors.\u00a0 So I went to them and I said, \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d\u00a0 So I met with \u2014 and they\u2019re privately owned, these ports \u2014 these two.\u00a0 So I met with the business people.\u00a0 I met with all their major customers \u2014 the Walmarts of the world and all the rest.\u00a0 There are like 70 ships waiting out there unable to get unloaded.\u00a0, So, I \u2014 and because \u2014 not always \u2014 the longshoremen don\u2019t always get along with the business folks in there.\u00a0 I got \u2014 I have a relationship with them.\u00a0 And I brought them together, and I said, \u201cYou got to be open 24\/7.\u201d\u00a0 No port there was open tw- \u2014 open five days a week, 40 hours a week.\u00a0 24\/7 \u2014 they\u2019ve all agreed to it.\u00a0 They\u2019ve agreed to it., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Would you consider the National Guard to help with the supply chain issue?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes, absolutely, positively, I would do that.\u00a0 But in addition to that, what you got to do is you got to get these ships in and unloaded.\u00a0, And one of the things in my \u2014 my infrastructure plan: There\u2019s $16 billion for port expansion.\u00a0 We have to be able to move things along.\u00a0 Because what\u2019s happening is, when we \u2014 a product your mother may need for interior design, in terms of drapery or colors or something, that is imported from somewhere else.\u00a0 Well, guess what?\u00a0 A lot of these places, particularly in South Asia, are closing down because of COVID.\u00a0 The businesses are just flat closing.\u00a0 They\u2019re \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 So, would you consider the National Guard for trucking?\u00a0 For \u2014 because there\u2019s a lot of problems \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 \u2014 with not enough truck drivers right now., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 But here\u2019s \u2014 and that\u2019s why what we\u2019re doing now \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Do you have a timetable for that?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I had a timetable to \u2014 first of all, I want to get the ports up and running, and get the railroads and the rail heads and the trucks in port ready to move.\u00a0 Because I\u2019ve gotten Walmart and others that say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to move stuff off of the port, into our warehouses.\u201d\u00a0 Which (inaudible)., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 So, are you \u2014 but you\u2019re actually talking about having National Guardsmen and women \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 The answer is \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 \u2014 driving trucks?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 The answer is: Yes, if we can\u2019t move the \u2014 increase the number of truckers, which we\u2019re in the process of doing., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Okay., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 If we did at this moment, we\u2019re not \u2014 but the whole point is: We\u2019ve got to get the small business as well, because the big guys are in trouble.\u00a0 And a lot of the product that your mother makes, the product she \u2014 the things she does in her interior design building, the material she buys from the larger outfits.\u00a0 I assume; I don\u2019t know that.\u00a0, I \u2014 I \u2014 but my whole point is: Small businesses need the help badly.\u00a0 Small businesses make up 60 percent of all the revenue coming from business out there., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 I want to bring in Linda Harris.\u00a0 She\u2019s from Elkridge, Maryland.\u00a0 She\u2019s a software project manager, Democrat.\u00a0 Linda, what\u2019s your question?, Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hey, President Biden., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hey., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My middle-class family of four lives on a pretty tight budget.\u00a0 My husband and I both work full-time at well-paying jobs, but we still struggle some months to make the ends meet.\u00a0 With rising gas prices and utility prices and grocery prices, we\u2019re feeling our discretionary income get squeezed and reduced.\u00a0 What plans does the administration have to help ease this kind of current crunch we\u2019re feeling?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, there\u2019s a number of things that have already been done.\u00a0 And it\u2019s hard \u2014 and people don\u2019t think about \u2014 the American Rescue Plan has provided for an awful lot \u2014 the $1.9 billion we passed right at \u2014 right after I got elected.\u00a0, So, what you got is you got that \u2014 that $1,400 check in the mail, and you got a lot of things that help ameliorate some of the concerns and costs, because we knew what we were coming into.\u00a0 We knew we had inherited the wind, and things were going to get worse before they got better.\u00a0, But in terms of being able to have what my dad used to say, \u201ca little breathing room,\u201d\u00a0just a lit- \u2014 my \u2014 my dad busted his neck.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t have a good-paying job.\u00a0 My dad was a well-read high-school-educated guy who thought his greatest sin in the world was he didn\u2019t get to go to college.\u00a0, And \u2014 but my dad was one of those guys that worked like hell, would come home for dinner, and then he\u2019d go back and finish up work and close the shop.\u00a0 He \u2014 and \u2014 and the whole point of it was that all we want to give \u2014 all he\u2019d talk about is \u201cJoey, all I need is just a little breathing room, a little space \u2014 a little space.\u201d, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Let me \u2014 let me ask you about that, just in terms of inflation, because you had told us at a town hall, I think it was in July, that the \u2014 it was just near-term inflation.\u00a0 The Wall Street Journal recently talked to like 67 financial experts who said that they saw high inflation going all the way \u2014 or deep into 2022.\u00a0 Do you think it\u2019s going to last for a while?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I \u2014 I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it will last if \u2014 depending what we do.\u00a0 If we stay exactly where we are, yes.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t make these investments, yes.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 What about gas prices?\u00a0 Because some states \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Gas pri- \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 \u2014 are seeing \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Gas prices relate to a foreign policy initiative that is about something that goes beyond the cost of gas.\u00a0 And we\u2019re about $3.30 a gallon most places now, when it\u2019s up from \u2014 when it was down in the single digits.\u00a0 I mean \u2014 single di- \u2014 a dollar-plus.\u00a0 And \u2014 and that\u2019s because of the supply being withheld by OPEC.\u00a0, And so, there\u2019s a lot of negotiation that is \u2014 there \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of Middle Eastern folks who want to talk to me.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Mm-hmm., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to talk to them.\u00a0 But the point is, it\u2019s about gas production.\u00a0 There is things we can do, in the meantime, though., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Do you think there\u2019s a \u2014 I mean, do you see a \u2014 do you have a timeline for gas prices of when you think they may start coming down?, THE PRESIDNET:\u00a0 My guess is you\u2019ll start to see gas prices come down as we get by \u2014 going into the winter \u2014 I mean, excuse me, into next year, in 2022.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to happen in the meantime that\u2019s going to significantly reduce gas prices.\u00a0, But, for example, for natural gas to heat your homes as winter is coming, there\u2019s a lot \u2014 what people don\u2019t realize: We put in billions of dollars in what they call \u201cLIHEAP.\u201d\u00a0 LIHEAP is the provision whereby you\u2019re able to get funding from the federal government based upon your need to heat your home, and it is subsidized in a significant way.\u00a0 And there\u2019s billions of dollars we have passed in the legislation I got passed in \u2014 in March of this year, because we anticipated that would be a problem, as well.\u00a0, But the answer ultimately is \u2014 \u201cultimately\u201d meaning the next three or four years \u2014 is investing in renewable energy.\u00a0 What I was able to do \u2014 (applause) \u2014 no, I \u2014 and, by the way, I really \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not being \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m being literal when I say this: What I was able to do when I ran \u2014 and you remember, Anderson, because I was on your show a couple times, and the issue was whether or not I could ever get the labor unions to support my environmental programs.\u00a0, And I went out and I went to the IBEW and, as well, to the autoworkers, and I laid out my plan.\u00a0 They fully embraced it.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because \u2014 and I spent time at General Motors and other companies, and I got General Mo- \u2014 I didn\u2019t get them \u2014 General Motors decided, after a long time spent talking to me \u2014 they were suing California because they had a higher standard \u2014 mileage standard.\u00a0 They dropped the suit and agreed that they would be 50 percent electric vehicles by 2030 \u2014 by 2030.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And now you have all three \u2014 all three major manufacturers saying the same thing.\u00a0, So, what will ha- \u2014 what will happen is: You\u2019re going to see a dramatic drop \u2014 a dramatic drop in what\u2019s going to happen in terms of gas prices as we go into the next two or three years.\u00a0 Even if we\u2019re not able to break the monopoly price \u2014 they\u2019re keeping it up because \u2014 anyway., So there\u2019s \u2014 there \u2014 but I don\u2019t \u2014 I must tell you, I don\u2019t have a near-term answer.\u00a0 There\u2019s two things I could do: I could go in the petroleum reserve and take out and probably reluce sic \u2014 reduce the price of gas maybe 18 cents or so a gallon.\u00a0 It\u2019s still going to be above three bucks.\u00a0, And one of the things that I refuse to have happen, because I didn\u2019t want anybody \u2014 I made a commitment: If you pass the stuff I\u2019m talking about, not \u2014 not one single penny in tax would go against anybody making less than 400 grand.\u00a0, And so, if you notice, this is \u2014 these highway bills are not paid for by gas tax.\u00a0 They\u2019re paid for by direct expenditures in other areas.\u00a0 So, the average person doesn\u2019t have to pay more., But it\u2019s going to be hard.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be hard.\u00a0 There\u2019s a possibility to be able to bring it down.\u00a0 Depends on \u2014 little bit on Saudi Arabia and a few other things that are in the offing., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Let me take a quick break.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have more from President Joe Biden.\u00a0 (Applause.), (Commercial break.), MR. COOPER:\u00a0 And welcome back to our CNN Town Hall with President Joe Biden.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Got a lot more questions to get to.\u00a0, I want to introduce Neijma Donner, a professor and social worker at the University of Maryland, Baltimore.\u00a0 She\u2019s an independent and mother of two young boys.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be talking about COVID.\u00a0, Neijma, what\u2019s your question?\u00a0, Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you for taking my question, President.\u00a0 When will the vaccines for young children be ready?\u00a0 And how accessible will they be once released?\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I believe \u2014 and I want to make it clear: Unlike past administrations, science will dictate this.\u00a0 I\u2019m not telling anyone at \u2014 (applause) \u2014 no, I really mean it.\u00a0 (Applause.), But I do ask my COVID team what the expectations are.\u00a0 The expectations are it\u2019ll be ready in the near term \u2014 meaning weeks, not \u2014 not months and months.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 That\u2019s number one.\u00a0, Number two, there are over 800,000 sites right now that exist in America where you can go get a vaccine.\u00a0 And you\u2019re going to be able to do that with your children, particularly \u2014 we\u2019re going to try to work it out to deal with childcare centers \u2014 make it available there \u2014 as well as your pediatricians and the \u2014 you know, and the docs \u2014 and finding places where you can do it.\u00a0 Some places are talking about doing at \u2014 you know, in churches on the weekend and that kind of thing.\u00a0, So there\u2019ll be plenty of places to \u2014 to be able to get the vaccine when \u2014 if and when it is approved.\u00a0, And it\u2019s likely to be approved.\u00a0 I spent a lot of time with the team on these things.\u00a0 And it\u2019s likely to be approved and what \u2014 whether it\u2019s Moderna or whether it\u2019s Pfizer or whether it\u2019s J&amp;J, it\u2019s going to be approved.\u00a0 And it will be a much smaller dose \u2014 basically the same dose, but a smaller dose.\u00a0 And they\u2019re doing a lot of tests on it right now.\u00a0, And \u2014 and those of you who have children or brothers or sisters who are between \u2014 you know, who are in that age category above 12, get \u2014 get the vaccine for them.\u00a0 Get the vaccine.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Get it now.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Let me ask you \u2014 Mr. President \u2014 Mr. President \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 By the way, there\u2019s two famous guys in this audience here.\u00a0 I just noticed.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Ben Cardin \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and Chris Van Hollen.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And the mayor!\u00a0 Holy mackerel.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Mr. \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 This is a busman\u2019s holiday for you guys, having to come here.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But thank you.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Mr. President, let me ask you a follow-up about that.\u00a0 As many as one in three emergency responders in some cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, right here in Baltimore, are refusing to comply with city vaccine mandates.\u00a0, I\u2019m wondering where you stand on that.\u00a0 Should police officers, emergency responders be mandated to get vaccines?\u00a0 And if not, should they be \u2014 stay at home or let go?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes and yes.\u00a0 (Applause.), And, by the way \u2014 by the way, I waited until July to talk about mandating, because I tried everything else possible.\u00a0 The mandates are working.\u00a0 All the stuff about people leaving and people getting \u2014 you have \u2014 you have everyone from United Airlines to Spirit \u2014 all these airlines.\u00a0 They\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re not going to get all \u2014 96, 97 percent of the people have gotten the vaccine.\u00a0, All the talk about all these folks who are going to leave the military if they were mandated \u2014 not true.\u00a0 You got about a 90-something percent vaccination rate.\u00a0, I mean, so there\u2019s a \u2014 the idea is that \u2014 look, the two things that concern me \u2014 one, are those who just tried to make this a political issue.\u00a0 \u201cFreedom.\u00a0 I have the freedom to kill you with my COVID.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 No, I mean, come on.\u00a0 \u201cFreedom.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Number one., Number two \u2014 the second one is that, you know, the gross misinformation that\u2019s out there.\u00a0 Like what they\u2019re saying about my buddy Colin Powell \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and he was my friend \u2014 who passed away.\u00a0 \u201cColin Powell was vaccinated, and he still died.\u201d\u00a0 Well, he knew he had serious underlying conditions.\u00a0 And it would be difficult \u2014 he clearly would have been gone earlier had he not gotten the vaccine, had he not gotten the \u2014 the shots., But my generic point is: There\u2019s so much misinformation.\u00a0, And you know what I find fascinating?\u00a0 I turn on Fox to find out how popular I am.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well, I \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 How are you doing there?\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT: \u00a0I\u2019m doing very well.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I think I\u2019m at 3 percent favorable.\u00a0 But \u2014 (laughter) \u2014, But all kidding aside, one of the things I find: Do you realize they mandate vaccinations?, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 At Fox headquarters.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I find that mildly fascinating.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 You find that mildly fascinating?\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Mildly fascinating., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 I want to bring in \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 Thaddeus Price from \u2014 (applause).\u00a0 This is Thaddeus Price from Randallstown, Maryland.\u00a0 He\u2019s a program coordinator at Morgan State University and a Democrat.\u00a0 (Applause.), Thaddeus, welcome.\u00a0, Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Good evening, Mr. President.\u00a0 You received overwhelming support from the Black community, and rightfully so.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Rightfully so.\u00a0 But now many of us are disheartened \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yep., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 as we watch a Congress fail to support police reform.\u00a0 We watch our voting rights vanish before our very eyes.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0, Mr. President, my question is: What will you do over the next three years to rectify these atrocities, secure our democracy, and ensure that freedoms and liberties that all Americans should be entitled to?\u00a0 (Applause.), THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 First of all, you\u2019ve stated the proposition accurately, in my view.\u00a0 I did get overwhelming support from the African American community.\u00a0 Only folks in Maryland understand Delaware is the eighth-largest Black population in America, as a percent of population.\u00a0 It\u2019s been the source of my support.\u00a0 The only folks that helped me more than Black men are Black women.\u00a0 (Applause.), And \u2014 and I tell you what my greatest regret is: My greatest regret is I have these \u2014 had these three major pieces of legislation that are going to change the circumstances for working-class folks and African Americans, as well, that I\u2019ve been busting my neck trying to pass.\u00a0 But what it\u2019s done is prevented me from getting deeply up to my ears \u2014 which I\u2019m going to do once this is done \u2014 in dealing with police brutality, dealing with the whole notion of: What are we going to do about voting rights?\u00a0 It\u2019s the greatest assault on voting rights in the history of the United States \u2014 for real \u2014 since the Civil War.\u00a0, Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Yes, sir., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And, you know, for example: When I was in the Chair- \u2014 when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I thought I had done something really important.\u00a0 And I was able to get passed and extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years and get everyone on that committee, including the southern \u2014 the senator from South Carolina and others, to vote for it.\u00a0 I thought we had moved.\u00a0, The point I\u2019m making is this: We\u2019re at a terrible place right now.\u00a0 And so, when this gets done \u2014 and in the meantime, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done: I have the authority to deal with federal law enforcement.\u00a0, So federal law enforcement, I\u2019ve \u2014 we\u2019ve issued mandates: no chokeholds, number one; make sure that we\u2019re going to be able to do \u2014 have no no-knock warrants; in a position where we\u2019re going to be able to see to it that we are able to go look at \u2014 and we\u2019re doing it in four cities right now \u2014 patterns of abuse and patterns of misconduct of police departments; making sure that we have access to police records, in terms of what\u2019s happening in \u2014, So there\u2019s a lot I\u2019ve been able to do by executive order, in essence., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Let me ask you, on voting rights: If it is as important to you as you say, I think there\u2019s a lot of Democrats who look at the filibuster and would like to see it changed, even if it was just on this one case.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Why do you oppose that?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 By the way, I think they make a very good point.\u00a0, Here\u2019s the deal: If, in fact, I get myself into, at this moment, the debate on the filibuster, I lose three \u2014 at least three votes right now to get what I have to get done on the economic side of the equation \u2014 the foreign policy side of the equation.\u00a0, So, what I have said \u2014 you\u2019re shaking your head no, but let me tell you something, Jack: It\u2019s the truth.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Number one., Number two.\u00a0 Number two, what I have proposed in the meantime is \u2014 it used to be the filibuster.\u00a0 The way it worked \u2014 and we have 10 times as many \u2014 more than that \u2014 times the filibuster has been used since 1978.\u00a0 It used to be you had to stand on the floor and exhaust everything you had, and you \u2014 when \u2014 and when you gave up the floor and someone else sought the floor, they had to talk until they finished.\u00a0 You\u2019re only allowed to do it a second time.\u00a0 After that, it\u2019s over; you vote \u2014 somebody moves for the vote.\u00a0 I propose we bring that back now, immediately.\u00a0 (Applause.), But I also think we\u2019re going to have to move to the point where we fundamentally alter the filibuster.\u00a0 The idea that, for example, my Republican friends say that we\u2019re going to default on the national debt because they\u2019re going to filibuster that and we need 10 Republicans to support us is the most bizarre thing I ever heard.\u00a0, I think you\u2019re going to see an aw- \u2014 if they \u2014 gets pulled again, I think you\u2019ll see an awful lot of Democrats being ready to say, \u201cNot me.\u00a0 I\u2019m not doing that again.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to end the filibuster.\u201d\u00a0, But it still is difficult to end the filibuster, beyond that.\u00a0 That\u2019s another issue.\u00a0 But \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 But \u2014 but are you saying once you get this current agenda passed on spending and social programs that you would be open to fundamentally altering the filibuster or \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I am open to \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 \u2014 doing away with it?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 fundamentally altering \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Or doing away with it?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, that remains to be seen, exactly what that means, in terms of \u201cfundamentally altering\u201d it, whether or not we just end the filibuster straight up.\u00a0, There are certain things that are just sacred rights.\u00a0 One\u2019s a sacred obligation that we never are going to renege on a debt.\u00a0 We\u2019re the only nation in the world \u2014 we have never, ever reneged on a single debt., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 But when it comes to voting rights, do you \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Voting rights is equally as consequential., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 When it comes to voting rights \u2014 just so I\u2019m clear, though \u2014 you would entertain the notion of doing away with the filibuster on that one issue?\u00a0 Is that correct?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And maybe more., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 And maybe other issues?\u00a0 (Applause.), Okay, let\u2019s \u2014 just a short time ago, the full House voted to hold \u2014 to hold former Trump ally, Steve Bannon \u2014 current Trump ally as well \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 in criminal contempt of Congress. \u00a0, A week ago, you said the Department of Justice should prosecute those who defied subpoenas from the January 6th Committee.\u00a0 Was that appropriate for you to weigh in on?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, the way I said it was not appropriate.\u00a0 I said \u2014 they asked me would I \u2014 do I think that he \u2014 they should be prosecuted for denying the \u2014 for not showing up at the committee.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0, Now that \u2014 when I\u2019ve made a commitment \u2014 the plu- \u2014 the \u2014 one of the things I was committed to do when I ran was re-establish the reputation and integrity of the Justice Department.\u00a0 It has become the most \u2014 it was corrupted under the last administration.\u00a0, I should have chosen my words more wisely.\u00a0 I did not, have not, and will not pick up the phone and call the Attorney General and tell him what he should or should not do in terms of who he should prosecute.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0, But, I answered the question honestly.\u00a0 And I think that a \u2014 anyone who does not respond to that kind of en- \u2014 question from the \u2014 from the \u2014 a legitimate committee in the House of Representatives or the United States Senate should be held accountable.\u00a0, So that\u2019s as much as I can say without coming and looking like I\u2019m telling the \u2014 I have yet to talk to the Attorney General about anything (inaudible) \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 The Attorney General put out a statement saying that they would make the decision on their own., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And they will., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Yeah., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I guarantee that., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 You\u2019ve decided not to exert executive privilege to shield the former President in the House\u2019s investigation into January 6th.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 What were you \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, again, I\u2019m leaving that to them to tell me what \u2014 and I didn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not a blanket \u201cI will not release the information.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s, I\u2019m asking them to take a look at what is legitimate \u2014 what would legitimately fall in the position that future Presidents\u2019 authority would be compromised by that, and what is.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much legitimacy in the claim.\u00a0, So that\u2019s being looked at right now., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 We\u2019re going to take another quick break.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have more with President Joe Biden.\u00a0 (Applause.), (Commercial break.), MR. COOPER:\u00a0 And welcome back to our CNN Town Hall with President Joe Biden.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking questions from the audience on a range of topics.\u00a0, I want to bring in Megan Crawford from Towson, Maryland.\u00a0 She\u2019s a law student at the University of Baltimore and a Republican.\u00a0, Megan, welcome.\u00a0 (Applause.), Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout your campaign, you\u2019ve criticized former President Trump for his treatment of illegal immigrants and the southern border.\u00a0 Given that it\u2019s nearly been a year into your campaign, why haven\u2019t you been to the southern border of our country?\u00a0 And why did your stance on allowing immigrants suddenly revert to Trump-era policies?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well \u2014 (applause) \u2014 they\u2019re legitimate questions.\u00a0 Number one, the Remain in Mexico policy, which I oppose, the Court said I had to maintain it.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re repealing it.\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the reasons why we haven\u2019t changed it.\u00a0, We have made a gigantic change \u2014 there were over 5,000 children \u2014 children \u2014 in the \u2014 in the custody of the Border Patrol.\u00a0 There are now 504.\u00a0 We are making more progress than you think.\u00a0, And we have a circumstance where one of the things that is going to bear fruit, I believe, is: I put together a program when I was a senator, and the Vice President is helping \u2014 helping initiate it now, where we provide for funding to change the circumstances on the ground in the countries in Central America.\u00a0, For example, you\u2019re in a circumstance where, you know, people don\u2019t just sit around their \u2014 their hand-hewn table and say, \u201cI got a great idea: Let\u2019s sell everything we have, give it to coyote, let them take us across the border, drop us in a desert \u2014 a place they don\u2019t want us.\u00a0 Won\u2019t that be fun?\u201d, People do it because they\u2019re desperate.\u00a0 They\u2019re desperate.\u00a0 And what I\u2019ve been trying to do \u2014 and I\u2019m trying to do in this legislation, as well \u2014 is get funding so we have funding for immigration officers to be able to hear cases immediately of whether or not they justify having asylum granted to them.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We don\u2019t have that., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 You have kept in place, under a Public Health Authority known as Title 42 \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 \u2014 which is a Trump-era policy, which allows immediate or very quick return to people who crossed over the border based on COVID protocols.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 And that is \u2014 we\u2019ve maintained that because of the extent of the \u2014 of the \u2014 continued extent of COVID in those countries from which people are coming.\u00a0 It\u2019s very, very high.\u00a0 And so, we\u2019ve maintained the policy.\u00a0, We are \u2014 we are not sending back children.\u00a0 We send back adults, and we send back fa- \u2014 large families.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t send back children in that circumstance.\u00a0, And so that\u2019s why I have a proposal to provide for over a billion doses of COVID vaccine to the rest of the world, including a significant portion to Latin and Central America., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Do you have plans to visit the southern border?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019ve been there before, and I haven\u2019t \u2014 I mean, I know it well.\u00a0 I guess I should go down.\u00a0 But the \u2014 but the whole point of it is: I haven\u2019t had a whole hell of lot of time to get down.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been spending time going around looking at the $900 billion worth of damage done by \u2014 by hurricanes and floods and \u2014 and weather, and traveling around the world.\u00a0, But I plan on \u2014 now, my wife, Jill, has been down.\u00a0 She\u2019s been on both sides of the river.\u00a0 She\u2019s seen the circumstances there.\u00a0 She\u2019s looked into those places.\u00a0 You notice you\u2019re not seeing a lot of pictures of kids lying on top of one another with \u2014 you know, with \u2014 with bla- \u2014 with, you know, looks like tarps on top of them.\u00a0, We\u2019ve been able to deal that \u2014 we\u2019ve been able to significantly increase funding through the HHS \u2014 Health and Human Services \u2014 to provide shelter for these kids and people.\u00a0 But there\u2019s much more to be done.\u00a0, And \u2014 and I realize \u2014 I \u2014 I think it is \u2014 it\u2019s the thing that concerns me the most about being able to get control of it.\u00a0 Because I got to, number one, get enough funding to provide for immediate determination of whether or not someone that is, in fact, legitimately claiming a right to stay in the country because of legitimate fears.\u00a0 And it\u2019s purely for economic reasons to get in line but not get in the country.\u00a0, So, what we\u2019re doing is bringing a lot of folks who are coming in and they\u2019re doing ankle bracelets instead of people being sent back, depending on whether or not their claim appears to be legitimate., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Let me ask you about two other issues in the news.\u00a0 In less than two weeks, Minneapolis voters are going to decide whether or not to replace the police department in Minneapolis with what they would call a \u201cPublic Safety Department.\u201d\u00a0 What do you think of that?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, it depends what they mean by that.\u00a0 Look, I \u2014 I \u2014 I grew up in a neighborhood \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 They said the Public Safety Department would be \u2014 have a more comprehensive public health approach to the delivery of functions of public safety and could include licensed peace officers \u2014 police officers., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, could.\u00a0 I think you need police officers.\u00a0 I think we need police officers to protect us.\u00a0 I think they have to be under certain changed circumstances.\u00a0 But I think we have to provide for them more opportu- \u2014 I call for more money for police to go to community policing, as well as dealing with additional help for psych- \u2014 psychologists and others working with police departments., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 You\u2019ve never been a fan of defunding police.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I haven\u2019t.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never supported.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve been a fan \u2014 (applause) \u2014 of controlling police and making sure they\u2019re held accountable.\u00a0 That\u2019s a \u2014 they\u2019re two different issues.\u00a0, And one of the things \u2014 look, when we had community policing, initially in the late \u201890s, violent crime dropped significantly \u2014 significantly.\u00a0 And the reason it did is because we had significant number of police.\u00a0 What I did: I eliminated the LEAA funding \u2014 Law Enforcement Assistance Act \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and I put in place the proposal that required community policing.\u00a0, What that meant was: If you were all \u2014 it\u2019s going to take a second, but it\u2019s important.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 If your \u2014 what \u2014 what that meant, if your city had authorized a police force of 100 people, you could not take the money for community policing and fire 50 people and rehire 50 so now I just had the federal government paying for half and you didn\u2019t increase the number of police., You had to increase the number of police beyond your wh- \u2014 whatever.\u00a0 So, I remember my son Beau was the chief law enforcement officer of the state of Delaware as attorney general of the state of Delaware.\u00a0 And he used to do what I did., He\u2019d go down the east side where you can find the best basketball in the coun- \u2014 in \u2014 in the city.\u00a0 You know, every \u2014 every town has those \u2014 those places.\u00a0 And he\u2019d sit there on the bench with my son \u2014 my grandson, Hunter, who\u2019s now 16, who was then 5, sitting the bench and he\u2019d get to know these guys., And he\u2019d walk over and he\u2019d knock on the window of the police car that was sitting there \u2014 the cop not getting out of the car \u2014 and say, \u201cGet the hell out of the car and meet these folks.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d, I\u2019ll give you one example: What we required initially was every police \u2014 every community policeman \u2014 there were two assigned \u2014 they were assigned in groups of two \u2014 they had to know the neighborhood., I remember getting a call, as you \u2014 you\u2019ve been to Delaware; you go down that road as you\u2019re heading down to the (inaudible) station \u2014 Martin Luther King Boulevard.\u00a0 There was a woman who lived in one of those apartments in the second floor that sort of had an outcroppings \u2014 a Victorian kind of \u2014 it was a two-story place.\u00a0, And what \u2014 but the cops made sure they had \u2014 she had their phone number.\u00a0 So, when a drug deal was going down, she\u2019d pick up the phone on call and say to that police officer with a cellphone that the drug deal is going down, knowing that she would never be fingered, knowing that she would never be the one told it happened.\u00a0 And so, crime began to drop.\u00a0, They had to know who owned the local liquor store.\u00a0 They had to know and walk in and shake hands with the local minister.\u00a0 They had to know \u2014 that\u2019s community policing., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Let me try to get in a couple other questions \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry., MR. COOPER: \u2014\u00a0from our audience., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Ask easy ones., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 But before we do, just another quick news question: New York City is removing a statue of Thomas Jefferson from its legislative chamber because of Jefferson\u2019s history as a slave \u2014 slave holder.\u00a0 Do you support that decision?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think that\u2019s up to the locality to decide what they want to do on that.\u00a0 Look, there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of people who have no social redeeming value, historically.\u00a0 And there\u2019s others who have made serious mistakes in they \u2014 in \u2014 in terms of what \u2014 what exists now in terms of what we should be talking about, but have done an awful lot.\u00a0, And so, the very thing \u2014 for example, I just spoke at the Martin Luther King dedication.\u00a0 And I pointed out that we\u2019re right across from the Lincoln Memorial.\u00a0 Well, you know, and \u2014 and you talked about \u2014 and \u2014 and then the Jefferson Memorial.\u00a0 And what \u2014 what are we doing?\u00a0 I talked about how they said, \u201cWe\u2019re unique in all the world, as a nation.\u00a0 We\u2019re the only nation founded on an idea.\u00a0 We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by\u2026\u201d, No nation has ever been founded on an idea.\u00a0 Have we ever lived up to it?\u00a0 No.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Let me br- \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But it\u2019s a pretty big idea that somebody wrote that down and got the rest of the country to agree to it.\u00a0 So it depends.\u00a0 It depends.\u00a0 And it\u2019s \u2014, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Let me bring \u2014 let me bring in Glenn Niblo, a student at Loyola University, originally from Connecticut.\u00a0 He\u2019s a Republican.\u00a0 Glenn, welcome.\u00a0 (Applause.), Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hi., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Where in Connecticut are you from?, Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Greenwich., THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s great., Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 China just tested a hypersonic missile.\u00a0 What will you do to keep up with them militarily?\u00a0 And can you vow to protect Taiwan?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes and yes.\u00a0 We are \u2014 militarily, China, Russia, and the rest of the world knows we have the most powerful military in the history of the world.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry about whether we\u2019re going to \u2014 they\u2019re going to be more powerful.\u00a0 What you do have to worry about is whether or not they\u2019re going to engage in activities that will put them in a position where there \u2014 they may make a serious mistake.\u00a0, And so, I have had \u2014 I have spoken and spent more time with Xi Jinping than any other world leader has.\u00a0 That\u2019s why you have \u2014 you know, you hear people saying, \u201cBiden wants to start a new Cold War with China.\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t want a Cold War with China.\u00a0 I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back.\u00a0 We are not going to change any of our views., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 So, are you saying that the United States would come to Taiwan\u2019s defense if \u2014, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 \u2014 China attacked?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes, we have a commitment to do that., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to take another quick break.\u00a0 We got more questions from the audience.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be right back.\u00a0 (Applause.), (Commercial break.), MR. COOPER:\u00a0 And welcome back.\u00a0 We are live with President Joe Biden, here in the city of Baltimore.\u00a0, Just in the few minutes we have left: The country lost \u2014 and I know you lost somebody who you considered close friend, General Colin Powell.\u00a0 What\u2019s something about him that people didn\u2019t know?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He had enormous integrity; they knew that.\u00a0 But he\u2019s one of the few serious, serious players I\u2019ve dealt with over these years who, when he made a mistake, he acknowledges it.\u00a0 He said, \u201cI ackno- \u2014 I was wrong about it.\u201d, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 That\u2019s rare these days.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, it\u2019s rare.\u00a0 It\u2019s been rare \u2014 it\u2019s rare in human nature for someone in a powerful position to say they are wrong.\u00a0 They are wrong.\u00a0 \u201cI made a mistake.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s a hard thing to do.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve had to do it about a half a dozen times lately.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But \u2014 but all kidding aside \u2014, And the second thing about him was he had a lot of serious \u2014 he had real compassion.\u00a0 You know, his \u2014 well, I\u2019ll tell you afterwards, but \u2014 because we only have a few minutes., He and I went out to the Secret Service racetrack.\u00a0 He had a brand-new Corvette his \u2014 his family bought \u2014 his kids bought him.\u00a0 And I have a \u201967 327\/350, and we raced.\u00a0 We raced.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.), And, you know \u2014 you know, the only reason \u2014 no, I\u2019m serious.\u00a0 It was on \u201cJay Leno.\u201d\u00a0 Check it out.\u00a0 \u201cJay Leno Live.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s a hell of a guy., MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Who won?, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I won only because he was worried I was going to crash into him.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Because I don\u2019t have positraction, so I was burning rubber the whole way out there, and I could see him going, \u201cWhoa.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.), MR. COOPER:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 So just \u2014 my final question is: You famously \u2014 at the signing ceremony, I think it was, for Obamacare, you famously leaned in to the then-President, and \u2014 I\u2019m not going to say a direct quote, but \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 off-mic, you said, \u201cThis is a big effing deal.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.), And I\u2019m wondering: The Build Back Better plan \u2014 is it a bigger effing deal than that?\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.), THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Sixty seconds.\u00a0 We got in the car to go over to the \u2014 the Department of Education after we did that.\u00a0, MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Oh, I thought you were talking about drag racing still.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no.\u00a0 He got in the car, and he was laughing like hell.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s so damn funny?\u201d\u00a0 And he told me., I whispered in his ear \u2014 this way.\u00a0 I looked to see where it was.\u00a0 I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to \u2014 and this is a big deal.\u201d\u00a0 And I didn\u2019t realize the guy behind me was really lipreading.\u00a0 You can see it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 No, I\u2019m serious.\u00a0, The answer is: Yes, this is bigger.\u00a0 No, it is bigger because \u2014 not \u2014 not because what he did wasn\u2019t enormous.\u00a0 He broke the ice.\u00a0 Enormous.\u00a0, But part of what I have in here is we also increased access to the Affordable Care Act, and we reduced the price an average of 60 bucks a month for anyone who\u2019s in the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0 Plus, on top of that, we have another 300 billion dollars\u2019 worth of healthcare ever \u2014 in it.\u00a0, So, it\u2019s \u2014 I would say this is a bigger darn deal.\u00a0 (Applause.), MR. COOPER:\u00a0 Mr. President, thank you very much.\u00a0 Appreciate your time.\u00a0, THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much., 9:29 P.M.

While the TikTok video itself was brand new, the three clips it displayed were all old.,  , The first two \u201cMatrix glitches\u201d in the video were about a briefcase that purportedly changed colors and a glass of water that moved on a Honduran TV broadcast. Both were explained in a previous fact check., For the third clip in the TikTok video that showed Pope Francis seemingly disappearing, the voiceover said: \u201cDuring a 2020 broadcast, Pope Francis seemed to vanish in thin air while stepping back inside after blessing the crowd.\u201d, We also found YouTube videos of the same moment, such as one titled, \u201cPope Francis disappears on live TV.\u201d Some used the words \u201cvanishes into thin air.\u201d, Unfortunately, the truth was less exciting., On April 13, 2020, Pope Francis presented the Regina Coeli prayer from the Vatican on the day after Easter Sunday. The moment came amid the beginning months of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Vatican, during his remarks he specifically acknowledged the role of women in combatting the coronavirus., The prayer appeared to be broadcast live and was later made available on YouTube. Pope Francis\u2019 prayer was also reported on by television news organizations across the world., The clip in the TikTok video may have come from a local news broadcast by Kalamazoo, Michigan-based, WWMT-TV., \u00a0According to the video, it does look like Pope Francis disappeared for a brief moment at the 0:36 mark in the clip. However, readers might be able to tell that this was nothing more than a video editing mistake., We found the full broadcast of the prayer at the Vatican. Beginning at the 15:22 mark in the following video, it\u2019s clear that Pope Francis did not disappear or vanish \u201cinto thin air.\u201d, \u00a0All three \u201cMatrix glitches\u201d in the TikTok video may have been interesting.

There are no screenshots of this \u201cevil Santa,\u201d nor any copies of the alleged video on which this rumor is based. We also have not seen any other reports about children encountering an \u201cevil Santa\u201d on YouTube Kids.\u00a0, A spokesperson for YouTube told us:, We\u2019ve not received evidence of there being videos on YouTube Kids showing or promoting the content described in the post. Additionally, on YouTube Kids, we provide parents with free tools to customize the experience for their kids and to control what content their child can and cannot see., It should be noted that Oxx\u2019s message, which has racked up close to 90,000 shares, claims that parents pay extra for parental controls on YouTube Kids. But that\u2019s not the case. As YouTube\u2019s spokesperson notes above, YouTube Kids provides free tools to customize their children\u2019s experience. You can read more about the available parental controls here., Little information is available about this specific rumor. While there is no real evidence for it, it\u2019s not entirely out of the realm of possibility. There have been a few instances over the years of trolls inserting self-harm messages into YouTube Kids videos. However, similar rumors claiming that children were being encouraged to harm themselves proved to be hoaxes.\u00a0, Vox reported: \u201cImages of a demonic chicken lady are stoking panic across the globe, with warnings of a dangerous \u201csuicide game\u201d that targets children on social media. But behind the hysteria linked to the so-called \u201cMomo challenge\u201d is an issue far more revealing: This urban legend is likely little more than a hoax fueled by media reports and parents\u2019 fears about their kids\u2019 online activity.\u201d, In 2019, after YouTube troll Filthy Frank inserted a clip promoting self-harm into a cartoon that was available on YouTube Kids, a YouTube spokesperson told Buzzfeed News that the company \u201cworks hard to ensure YouTube is not used to encourage dangerous behavior and we have strict policies that prohibit videos which promote self-harm\u201d and that \u201cevery quarter we remove millions of videos and channels that violate our policies and we remove the majority of these videos before they have any views.\u201d, The viral Facebook post reads:, Just a heads up for anyone with YouTube kids.William who is 5!

Elements of the claim are true, but have been distorted or misrepresented in some cases. In some (but not all) cases, it is true that obligated funds were issued by the NIAID  for research conducted on beagle subjects. However, it is unclear whether Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID), personally approved the projects. Research conducted on behalf of NIAID is funded in large part through annual funds allocated by Congress and the president. The NIAID-funded tests were approved under federal regulations established to protect animal welfare. , Throughout the latter half of 2021, the taxpayer watchdog group White Coat Waste Project (WCW) released announcements that it had exposed several government-funded \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d research projects that tested potential vaccines and drug therapeutics on beagles, which collectively cost taxpayers millions of dollars. In all cases, WCW pointed blame at Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whom the group posited as having given the final approval to fund the projects.\u00a0, Snopes readers asked our team to focus our investigation on three of the studies in question, which included research conducted at the University of Georgia Research Foundation (UGR) the nonprofit research institute SRI International, and by scientists in Tunisia.\u00a0, The allegations began in July 2021, when the Republican-led animal rights advocacy group published a report that claimed Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, approved funding from taxpayer dollars to conduct \u201cpainful experiments\u201d on beagles.\u00a0, WCW claimed in its July 30 report that Fauci, in an attempt to advance a human vaccine for a parasitic disease called lymphatic filariasis, \u201cspent $424,000 to commission a study in which healthy beagles are given an experimental drug and then intentionally infested with flies that carry a disease-causing parasite that affects humans.\u201d The findings of the WCW investigation were subsequently reported in publications like Fox News and conservative-leaning outlets such as RT, The Federalist, The Daily Caller, and The Patriot Project., , In October 2021, Republican U.S. House Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina tweeted a letter she sent to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, referencing documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request from WCW. WCW claimed that from October 2018 to February 2019, Fauci \u201cordered cruel and unusual drug toxicity tests on dogs\u2026 that cost taxpayers $1.68 million.\u201d\u00a0, , In a third report, WCW claimed that NIAID funded more than $375,000 to conduct a study that again used beagles as test subjects in experiments involving sand flies that the organization described as \u201ctorture.\u201d, Snopes contacted WCW and obtained copies of documents reportedly obtained via separate Freedom of Information Act requests submitted by the organization. Claims of Fauci funding the \u201ctorture\u201d of dogs circulated and recirculated in Fall 2021 and are largely based on two studies funded by the NIAID that did, indeed, involve using beagles as test subjects.\u00a0, We break those claims down below, but first, a closer look at the organization behind the reports.\u00a0, Founded in 2013, WCW is a watchdog group that is self-described as representing more than 2 million \u201cliberty lovers and animal-lovers\u201d who oppose using taxpayer dollars to support experiments on animals. It is not a traditional animal advocacy group but instead devotes its efforts to denouncing what it characterizes as wasted government funds spent on testing., In 2016, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) reported that the Washington, D.C.-based organization is the \u201cbrainchild\u201d of former Republican strategist Anthony Bellotti., \u201cHis opposition to animal research began in 1995, when, in the summer between high school and college, he worked in a hospital laboratory that was conducting heart studies on pigs and witnessed experiments he saw as cruel. After he became a political consultant, he hit upon the idea of framing such research as a waste of taxpayer money,\u201d wrote AAAS., Following the UGR investigation into the lymphatic filariasis studies, a spokesperson for WCW told Snopes that in August 2021, the watchdog group also requested documents related to toxicity testing on beagles \u201ccommissioned by Anthony Fauci\u2019s NIAID.\u201d, Snopes read through the file to verify the claims made in the WCW report specific to NIH contract number HHSN272201400006I, which was described in a government database as \u201cpreclinical development services for AIDS therapeutics\u201d with SRI International, a California-based nonprofit scientific research institute. According to the government fiduciary site USA Spending, a $1.1 million grant was awarded to the organization by DHHS on behalf of the NIAID. The study was listed to begin July 15, 2020, and wrap up by Dec. 24, 2021, and included testing on small animals for therapeutics to treat HIV as well as Hepatitis B and C viruses.\u00a0, \u201cThe request returned 1,438 pages of documents describing \u2018wasteful and unnecessary drug toxicity tests on beagle puppies,\u2019\u201d a WCW spokesperson told Snopes. The documents are hosted on our site at the link below.\u00a0, https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/uploads\/2021\/10\/maddap_beagles.pdf, The records outlined several studies involving both rats and beagles. The documents outline both the proposed study design as well as the actual results of the study, the latter of which resulted in 40 beagles between the ages of 8 and 9 months being administered oral and subcutaneous (under the skin) doses of an unnamed HIV therapeutic between September 2018 and October 2019., It is true that all dogs were euthanized following the study and their organs were analyzed for potential toxicity from the drugs.\u00a0, It is also true that the dogs vocal cords were \u201ccut out.\u201d In an statement emailed to MedPage Today, NIAID told the publication that the contract for \u201cpreclinical pharmacology and toxicology services\u201d was conducted \u201cas required in animal models by the FDA, in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines and in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) or its equivalent.\u201d, \u201cVocal cordectomies, conducted humanely under anesthesia, may be used in research facilities where numerous dogs are present,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis is to reduce noise, which is not only stressful to the animals but can also reach decibel levels that exceed OSHA allowable limits for people and can lead to hearing loss.\u201d, The housing and care of the beagles at the time of the study was in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, while welfare requirements were met in accordance with regulations established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture through the Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare.\u00a0, \u201cEvery effort will be made to minimize , if not eliminate, pain and suffering in all animals in this study. Moribund animals and animals experiencing undue pain and suffering will be euthanized at the discretion of the Study Director, attending veterinarian, or other qualified person. The Study Director will make every effort to protect the scientific validity of the study,\u201d read the document., While at least some of the funding was provided by NIAID, it is still unclear whether Fauci personally signed off on approving the research.\u00a0, Claims of Fauci ordering the funding of therapeutic testing on beagles originated with a 38-page FOIA request submitted by WCW and shared publicly in July.\u00a0Those are hosted in this Dropbox folder and have been archived on our site:, \u00a0Snopes read through the document, and our analysis confirmed that obligated funds were issued to the UGR by the NIH in the amount of $424,555 to determine the efficacy of a potential vaccine for lymphatic filariasis on beagle test subjects. A contract shared online by the U.S. government defined the research as: \u201cPRE-CLINICAL MODELS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES; TASK C12 LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS VACCINE (LFGUARD) EFFICACY TRIAL IN DOGS.\u201d, Research conducted on behalf of NIAID is funded in large part through annual funds allocated by Congress and the president, though direct projects may be signed off on by various leaders within NIH. However, there is no evidence that the grant was personally approved by Fauci and there is no mention of him in the FOIA documentation. All that we can definitively say is that at least some\u00a0of the money came from NIH.\u00a0, Neither the NIH nor UGR responded to Snopes\u2019 requests to verify the documents published by WCW, but a spokesperson for WCW sent our team a letter, written by NIAID Government Information Specialist Lauren Bartok in response to the FOIA request under case number 55876. The letter referenced the experimental documents obtained by WCW, confirming that the experiments took place., As with the first study, personal and proprietary information had been removed from the document, including the name of the vaccine and experiment objectives. The files did note that the contractor (UGR) was to acquire \u201chealthy, adult beagle dogs\u201d to \u201cadminister different formulations presumably of vaccine to dogs via the intramuscular route.\u201d, \u201cEach set of experiments will use 14 dogs, which total 28 dogs at completion of the study (7 dogs in each group),\u201d read the statement of work., Studies began in mid-November 2020 at which point the \u201cpathogen-free adult beagle dogs\u201d were scheduled to receive a total of three doses on days 0, 28, and 56. Throughout the study, researchers were instructed to monitor the dogs\u2019 health twice daily and collect blood and urine samples., A first dose of the vaccine was administered on Nov. 12 with a second-round given on Dec. 17 \u201cwithout incident with one important exception.\u201d That exception was four dogs in the so-named \u201cblue\u201d group reported as having \u201cvocalized in pain upon administration.\u201d After a physical examination five days later, the four dogs were observed as being \u201cbright, alert, and responsive.\u201d, A third and final round was administered on Jan. 14, 2021, also without incident but with \u201cone important exception.\u201d Half of the animals in the \u201cblue\u201d group again \u201cvocalized in pain upon administration.\u201d A week later, they were once gain deemed \u201cbright, alert and responsive.\u201d Emails sent between the researchers were included in the FOIA documents and confirmed that only the \u201cblue\u201d group showed a \u201cconsistent pain response.\u201d, The research is scheduled to be completed by Jan. 15, 2022, and all animals \u201cwill be euthanized after day 196,\u201d read the FOIA document., The UGR contract noted the vaccine was for lymphatic filariasis, a mosquito-borne parasitic infection, caused by microscopic, thread-like worms. When inside of their human hosts, these filarial worms live in the human lymph system and can cause elephantiasis and, in men, a condition called hydrocele that causes the swelling of the scrotum, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0(CDC)., Lymphatic filariasis affects an estimated 120 million people worldwide with another 1.2 billion at risk of infection, wrote researchers in 2014. Currently, there is no vaccine available for human cases, though treatment typically consists of chemotherapy and multiple drug therapies., But as the White Coat Project reported, vaccines for the disease have been tested in mice \u2014 and were shown to be 90% effective \u2014 and macaques (70% effective). In fact, at least 27 related animal experiments have been conducted since the 1940s on filarial worms. While WCW deemed the experiments \u201ccruel and unnecessary\u201d and claimed that some of the dogs were \u201cbitten to death,\u201d the NIH contends that all research involving animals is overseen by the agency\u2019s Office of Laboratory Welfare to ensure it is conducted ethically.\u00a0, \u201cAll animals used in NIH-funded research are protected by laws, regulations, and policies that ensure the smallest number of subjects and the greatest commitment to their welfare,\u201d notes the agency on its website., Furthermore, no evidence was put forward showing that the dogs were subject to biting, let alone \u201cbitten to death.\u201d If any such information was included in the FOIA document, it has since been redacted.\u00a0, In an interview with Newsweek, Greg Trevor, associate vice president for marketing and communications at UGR, confirmed that the research was for a potential vaccine that was developed and another institution. In an emailed statement, Trevor reportedly told the publication that \u201cunder federal rules, a vaccine must be tested in two animal species before it can be cleared for human clinical trials.\u201d NIAID decided to fund this research and that it needed to be conducted on a dog model, of which beagles are the \u201cstandard.\u201d, \u201cBecause this disease currently has no cure, unfortunately, the animals that are part of this trial must be euthanized. We do not take lightly the decision to use such animals in some of our research,\u201d Trevor reportedly told the publication., The third study took place in Tunisia and analyzed whether a species of sand fly (Phlebotomus perniciosus) was noticeably attracted to beagles who were infected with Leishmania infantum, the parasite that causes the skin disease leishmaniasis. Sand flies are the main vector of L. infantum and dogs are the main host and reservoir of the disease.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though the research took place, NIAID did not fund the study and the journal that published the study, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, issued a correction after reporting that the federal agency did support the study.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe manuscript mistakenly cited support from NIAID, when in fact NIAID did not support this specific research shown in the images of the beagles being circulated,\u201d NIAID told Politifact., PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases confirmed to MedPage Today that the mistake was made and posted a correction online, adding that NIAID \u201cdid not provide any funding for this research and any such claim was made in error.\u201d\u00a0, Research conducted on behalf of NIAID is funded in large part through congressional and executive actions deciding how to allocate taxpayer dollars. These annual allocations are then signed off on by the sitting president., NIAID funding for the fiscal year 2021 was awarded $5.4 billion by then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020. The following year, President Joe Biden requested an increase of $178.9 million, or 2.9%, for a total of $6.2 billion to be awarded in the fiscal year 2022. It is true that research conducted at UGR and SRI International was at least in part funded by NIAID with taxpayer dollars, though it is unclear whether such allocations were personally approved by Fauci., Sources:, \u201c#55876 Final.Pdf.\u201d Dropbox, https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/3rluc7ikty2d9sm\/%2355876%20Final.pdf?dl=0.

The controversial recount is being performed by Cyber Ninjas, a private firm hired by the Republican-led Arizona Senate, led by a proponent of Trump\u2019s election disinformation campaign alleging a massive-scale vote fraud conspiracy that supposedly cost Trump the election., During an appearance on May 18, 2021, on the CNN primetime show \u201cDon Lemon Tonight,\u201d Richer stated\u00a0the following when asked what the craziest conspiracy theory about the Arizona recount that he has heard:, No, the craziest conspiracy theory by far is that one of the board of supervisors who happens to own a very large chicken farm took ballots from the 2020 election, fed them to 165,000 chickens and then had them incinerated. Now, what actually happened is that this poor man had a serious fire at one of his barns and 165,000 chickens did die., But the idea that they had ballots inside of them \u2014 I mean, you know, and legitimate people indulge this. A prominent member of the state legislature indulged this in a conversation. And it is just, you know, what is going on here? That\u2019s facially laughable., The chicken-ballot narrative appears to have originated with a false claim published by the pro-Trump conspiracy site Gateway Pundit, which on March 6, 2021, reported that, \u201cDumpsters full of shredded ballots were located today in Maricopa County Arizona.\u201d, The Gateway Pundit story appears to have been lifted from a Facebook post from Pinal County resident Staci Burk, a pro-Trump \u201cStop the Steal\u201d activist, who had filed a failed lawsuit challenging the 2020 presidential election results. Burk\u2019s post stated that dumpster divers had recovered shredded ballots from behind the Maricopa County ballot tabulation center, and alleged that was evidence of election malfeasance., Richer\u2019s office debunked that claim at that time. Maricopa County Elections Department spokesperson Megan Gilbertson told the Arizona Mirror in a story published March 9, 2021, that the shredded ballots weren\u2019t from the 2020 election. State law, she said, requires election officials to keep ballots for 24 months after an election is canvassed., Gilbertson noted that the county sends out sample ballots, which are printed on the same paper as the ballots used in the election, and that such ballots are also available online. And there are many voters who received ballots in the mail but didn\u2019t return them, she said., \u201cThe ballot shown in the picture could be any one of those things. What it is not is an official voted ballot from the November General Election. The 2.1 million voted ballots from the November General Election are safe and accounted for in a vault, under 24\/7 surveillance,\u201d Gilbertson said., Chance would have it that on March 6, tragedy struck the family business of Maricopa County District 4 Supervisor Clint Hickman, and the \u201cshredded ballots\u201d conspiracy theory metastasized., A fire broke out at the farm and destroyed two barns at the Hickman\u2019s Family Farms location roughly 50 miles west of Phoenix. In that fire, 166,000 egg-laying hens perished., The Gateway Pundit seized on this fire, with a headline that same day that read, \u201cAfter Finding Shredded Ballots in the Dumpster Earlier Today \u2013 A Mysterious Fire Breaks Out at Maricopa County Official\u2019s Farm.\u201d, The Gateway Pundit story further reported, \u201cIndividuals in the county found shredded ballots at this location today (Saturday, March 6th). And now tonight two barns on the farm of one of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors caught on fire,\u201d adding later, \u201cThere better be a good investigation into these fires. Did any shred catch fire in the chicken coops?\u201d, A flurry of conspiratorial social media posts connecting the chicken fire to the false claims about shredded ballots followed. Here is an example of one:, , No., We reached out to the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is the agency investigating the cause of the fire, and the Buckeye Valley Fire District, the firefighters who responded to extinguish the blaze. Both told us there was no evidence of wrongdoing, and no evidence found that ballots were destroyed at the site., According to a fire report provided to Snopes by Buckeye Valley Fire District upon a public records request, emergency crews responded to a structure fire on Salome Highway in the city of Tonopah just after 1 p.m. A second structure also caught fire as crews battled the blaze. One person was transported to the hospital in stable condition.\u00a0, Maricopa Sheriffs told us in an email that, \u201cThe investigation revealed there was no evidence of a crimes. The cause of the fire was listed as unknown. The Arson investigation revealed no election ballots.\u201d, Company, Navigate, Sections, Account, \u00a9 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc., This material may not be reproduced without permission., Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"},{"content":"Yes, EPCOT has a sinkhole. As the Disney vloggers The Mouselets mentioned on TikTok, the Walt Disney World Resort theme park is \u201chiding a huge secret\u201d under part of the property in Orlando, Florida.,  , The video claims there\u2019s a large space between two key areas of EPCOT because that\u2019s precisely where a sinkhole was observed before the Disney World park opened in 1982., To learn more, we jumped back in time to newspaper archives from 1981. On May 19 of that year, the Orlando Sentinel printed that Disney officials denied the rumor of a sinkhole where EPCOT was being constructed., Fast forward 31 years to when we learned more about the EPCOT sinkhole rumor from D23, the official Disney fan club. D23 is perhaps best known for its official, biennial event that showcases the world of Disney., On Oct. 5, 2012, the Orlando Sentinel reported that \u201clongtime Imagineer Marty Sklar shared fun facts in a prerecorded presentation.\u201d Sklar had worked for The Walt Disney Company since 1956 and eventually served as vice chairman and principal creative executive for Walt Disney Imagineering., The Sentinel went on: \u201cAnd he recalled a big obstacle to building EPCOT: a sinkhole between Future World and World Showcase. \u2018I still don\u2019t think we found the bottom of that,\u2019 Sklar said.\u201d, We were unable to find a recording of the presentation on YouTube. However, we did uncover further reporting., According to silive.com, a publication that covers news about Staten Island, New York, Sklar also mentioned a man named John Tishman, who was referred to as \u201ca pioneer of construction management.\u201d According to the story, his firm built EPCOT and the original twin towers for the World Trade Center., \u201cJohn told us that building EPCOT was more difficult than building the World Trade Center buildings,\u201d Marty said. It had a lot to do with meeting the seemingly impossible deadline. \u201cOctober 1st was never a problem,\u201d Tishman said. \u201c1982 was the problem.\u201d, One of the many hurdles that needed to be tackled in constructing EPCOT \u2014 and, indeed, building anything on Walt Disney World property \u2014 is the fact that many of the structures had to be placed on top of former swampland., \u201cOne of the reasons there\u2019s so much space between Future World and the World Showcase lagoon is that we discovered a gigantic sink hole near where the Odyssey Restaurant is in EPCOT,\u201d Marty said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t build anything on top of it.\u201d, He related how workers tried in vain to shore up the land by driving massive piles into the earth, \u201cbut the piles just kept getting sucked into the ground.\u201d They covered the sink hole by placing giant steel plates on top of it., Sklar died in 2017 after having made a lifetime of contributions to The Walt Disney Company., In sum, it\u2019s true that there\u2019s a sinkhole under part of EPCOT at Disney World. The data we used to make this determination comes from a credible figure in Disney history who described the EPCOT sinkhole at an official company function in 2012. We were unable to find any official information about the sinkhole\u2019s size., We reached out to Disney World for further comment, and will update this story if we receive a response., Sources, Company, Navigate, Sections, Account, \u00a9 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc., This material may not be reproduced without permission., Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"},{"content":""},{"content":"This website uses cookies to improve the user experience.

However, the compound has not been tried on human test subjects and as yet there is no published, peer-reviewed, scientific literature describing such a development. , In late 2021, news of a potential brain cancer-killing compound circulated on the internet, claiming that student researchers at the University of Findlay College of Pharmacy in Ohio developed a compound that kills glioblastoma cells, which are at the center of one of the most aggressive and fatal types of brain cancer., Snopes readers sent our team the below image, asking us to verify whether the research was as promising as it sounded., By and large, there are true elements to this claim but social media posts left out some important details. For starters, the research was conducted in August 2019 and at the time, the university said that related work was in its infancy and still required \u201cyears\u2019 worth of study\u201d to determine the drug\u2019s efficacy., Furthermore, student researchers at the university identified a compound that they believe can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), making it a potential route to transport medication directly to the brain without the need to physically access the brain through surgery. However, the study therapeutic had neither been tested in animals or humans nor had it been described in scientific, peer-reviewed literature., Because the drug has not been tested or approved for use in humans, we have rated this claim as \u201cUnproven.\u201d\u00a0, As part of a two-year project, students and researchers at the pharmacy school developed a compound they named RK-15 mainly composed of chalcone, a plant-derived natural ingredient used to flavor foods like curry that is known for anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. In theory, medication could attach to RK-15 and cross through the BBB to deliver medication directly to the brain to combat cancers like glioblastomas, avoiding the need for invasive surgery., Glioblastoma forms around cells called astrocytes that support nerve cells, notes the Mayo Clinic. It is rare among cancer types, about 1 per 10,000 cases, but makes up about 16% of all brain cancers and is almost always lethal, according to a study published in the Journal of the Association of Basic Medical Sciences. Surgery is typically necessary to remove a glioblastoma, but because it grows into brain tissue, complete removal is not possible and treatment usually involves additional post-surgery treatments like radiation and chemotherapy., Treating brain cancers like glioblastoma is made more difficult in large part due to the impermeability of BBB, an immunological lining in parts of the brain. The BBB prevents most toxins and pathogens from entering is described by the American Society for Microbiology as a \u201cstructural and functional roadblock to microorganisms\u201d that may be circulating in the bloodstream to protect the central nervous system. But the BBB can also prevent medication from entering the brain, an obstacle that has launched the study of things like RK-15 that can cross the barrier to deliver neuropharmaceuticals and target receptors in the brain. If proven effective, such work could remove the need for invasive medical procedures that require surgeons directly access the brain., But as a news release stated, the research was in very preliminary stages and had neither been tested in animals \u2014 nor humans, for that matter \u2014 and had not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. In other words, it\u2019s a promising idea that to date lacks scientific backing establishing its feasibility., Snopes contacted the university for more information on the current stage of research is but did not hear back in time of publication.

One of the claims centered on the 1980 film adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s horror novel \u201cThe Shining,\u201d alleging:, From Danny\u2019s shirt to the movie he is watching on a TV that isn\u2019t plugged in (?), the number 42 is ominously in the background. Oh, and in case you were wondering, the movie showing on the not-plugged-in TV, is Summer of \u201942., Whilst the relic of 42 continues throughout the whole movie, there are also subtler appearances dropped throughout. On the TV there are exactly 42 cars parked at the Overlook, whilst a news reporter talks about a $42 million spending bill., In other words, the website called Nature World Today claimed the number \u201c42\u201d appeared in scenes throughout the fictional, R-rated movie directed by Stanley Kubrick. The film stars Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance (an aspiring writer who becomes The Overlook Hotel\u2019s caretaker and is eventually possessed by its evil spirits), Shelley Duvall as Wendy Torrance (Jack\u2019s wife), and Danny Lloyd as Danny (Jack and Wendy\u2019s five-year-old son)., Not to mention, multiply the individual numerals of Room 237 \u2014 a haunted room at The Overlook Hotel \u2014 (2x3x7) and you get 42., See also from Snopes: Is This True About Moth on \u2018Silence of the Lambs\u2019 Poster?, We determined the claim \u201cTrue\u201d by obtaining a digital version of the film via HBO Max and starting it from the beginning. We looked for the following: a \u201c42\u201d on Danny\u2019s shirt, the 1971 film titled \u201cSummer of \u201942\u201d playing on a TV, 42 vehicles parked at the hotel, and a reporter referencing a \u201c$42 million spending bill.\u201d, Snopes spotted one of the alleged Easter eggs within the first three minutes. After the opening credits roll (showing Kubrick as the film\u2019s producer, director and co-screenwriter), the camera pans across a mountainous scene with a two-lane highway., At one point, the viewer sees a glimpse of a massive building, The Overlook Hotel, and the camera zooms in closer to the property. There, yes, 42 vehicles are parked outside, including what appears to be a maintenance vehicle. (A split-second part of the camera\u2019s pan, however, shows another handful of vehicles off to the side.), Also, it was true that, around the 10:40 mark of the film, the camera begins focusing on Danny in the bathroom wearing a shirt with a red \u201c42\u201d on its sleeve. He is standing on a step stool and talking to \u201cTony,\u201d an imaginary figure that guides the 5-year-old with psychic premonitions., Then, about 40 minutes later, the camera zooms out from a television indeed playing \u201cSummer of \u201942,\u201d as Danny watches from the floor and his mother, Wendy, lies on a nearby couch. (We made that conclusion by cross-referencing what\u2019s depicted on the TV with still images from the official IMDb page of \u201cSummer of \u201942\u201d and that movie\u2019s official trailer.) Below is a photograph of that scene from \u201cThe Shining\u2019s\u201d IMDb page., , After that, the number \u201c42\u201d is allegedly referenced again as\u00a0Scatman Crothers\u2018 character (Dick Hallorann, a cook at Overlook who takes a special interest in Danny\u2019s telepathic abilities) lies in a bed in Florida. The camera again tracks back from a television screen in front of Hallorann supposedly showing a news broadcast \u201cfrom channel 10 in Miami.\u201d, First, a reporter shares a national weather update, and the camera focuses on Hallorann as the suspenseful music gradually gets louder. The journalist allegedly mentions a \u201c$42 million spending bill\u201d as the music takes the auditory foreground. We were unable to make out the exact dollar amount of something the reporter referenced supposedly involving \u201cthe city commission.\u201d, See also from Snopes: \u2018Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t F*** with Me\u2019 Letter.\u2019, It is unknown exactly why Kubrick, who died in 1999, included the \u201c42\u201d numerological motif multiple times throughout the film and whether it has any secret meaning., A\u00a0blog created by Kubrick\u2019s fans hypothesized that Kubrick repeatedly referenced the number 42 (as well as 24, 21, and 12) after studying Sigmund Freud\u2018s writings outlining the \u201cunsettling effect that recurring numbers can have.\u201d, It is possible, as well, the original BBC Radio 4 broadcast of Douglas Adams\u2019 \u201cHitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\u201d \u2014 which aired via multiple episodes in 1978 \u2014 influenced Kubrick. According to The Frida Cinema, an Orange County art house nonprofit, scenes from \u201cThe Shining\u201d were shot in London that same year.\u00a0, Meanwhile, Geoffrey Cocks, a retired history professor, has a more specific theory. Cocks \u2014 a source in the 2012 documentary \u201cRoom 237\u201d that dissects the film\u2019s possible hidden messages and author of the book titled, \u201cThe Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History, and the Holocaust\u201d \u2014 believes the \u201c42\u201d reference helps paint an allegory about Nazi extermination., \u201c1942 was the year of the Final Solution, and 42 has been used as shorthand to refer to the Holocaust,\u201d Vulture published in 2013, citing Cocks\u2019 theory., We reached out to Christiane Kubrick, the director\u2019s widow, for an interview to possibly shed light on why he included the numerical reference and whether any of the above-explained theories had any truth. We haven\u2019t gotten a response from her, but we will update this report if that changes., Sources:, Easter Eggs Waiting to Be Found in Thrillers \u2013 Page 22. https:\/\/natureworldtoday.com\/easter-eggs-waiting-to-be-found-in-thrillers-is\/22\/.

According to the rumor, vaccine recipients were supposedly being injected with formulas containing more ingredients than what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had \u201capproved\u201d for the immunizations., \u201cThe FDA approved version of the \u2018vaccine\u2019 had 3 ingredients. The version being injected into the public has 7,\u201d the reader wrote to us, referring to a post supposedly seen on Facebook., , The reader\u2019s inquiry included other claims, including the false notion that FDA-endorsed formulas by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson\u00a0(J&amp;J) did not \u201cfit the definition\u201d of vaccines but were rather \u201cexperimental treatments\u201d for the coronavirus. (Here\u2019s a portal of evidence on the FDA\u2019s website outlining the agency\u2019s approval of the immunizations,\u00a0debunking that assertion.) For the purpose of this fact check, however, we will focus on the allegation about the immunizations\u2019 amount of ingredients., See also from Snopes:\u00a0Does J&amp;J COVID-19 Vaccine Contain Aborted Fetal Cells?, Before we address the crux of the claim, a note on semantics: As of this writing, the FDA had only granted \u201cfull approval\u201d to one type of vaccine \u2014 Pfizer\u2019s. However, the federal agency gave the formulas by Moderna and J&amp;J \u201cemergency use authorizations\u201d (EUA), allowing for their mass distribution to help end the deadly pandemic as fast as possible. That endorsement, while it was not a full approval, confirmed the shots\u2019 safety and effectiveness after testing them on tens of thousands of people., While the post displayed above used the phrase \u201cFDA-approved\u201d without specifying which immunization it was referring to, we considered ingredients for all three vaccines, no matter if they had full FDA approval or EUA\u2019s., Firstly, here\u2019s the FDA\u2019s list of ingredients for Pfizer\u2019s shot, as outlined via documentation on its website:, mRNA, lipids ((4- hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 (polyethylene glycol)-2000-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol), potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose., In other words, the formula contained mRNA molecules (the messenger ribonucleic acids\u00a0that help immune systems fight COVID-19), as well as salt, sugar, a variety of fatty acids and a handful of other compounds, for a total of seven ingredients., Next, we considered the FDA\u2019s list of elements that make up Moderna and J&amp;J\u2019s formulas, respectively. They are as follows, according to FDA records obtained by Snopes:, , , Like Pfizer\u2019s shot, those immunizations contain seven or eight ingredients \u2014 not three, like the post claimed., Next, we sought evidence to confirm or deny the allegation that vaccine administrators at certified sites across the U.S.\u2014 either at clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, etc. \u2014 had injected people with fluids that did not contain the above-listed ingredients. We found no reported instances of that happening, whether intentionally or unintentionally. (That\u2019s not to say fraudulent vaccines don\u2019t exist. Get more information from the FDA on those here.), In sum, we considered the claim that people were receiving COVID-19 vaccinations containing more ingredients than what the FDA had endorsed for the public a baseless conspiracy theory.

This rumor is almost certainly a modern day invention, and the photographs commonly attached to this claim are unrelated. , One common claim that is often circulated on social media holds that there was a car accident in 1895 that involved the only two cars in the entire state of Ohio.\u00a0, , We\u2019ve been unable to find any documentation showing that such a crash occurred and the above-displayed photograph certainly wasn\u2019t taken in 1895.\u00a0, John Mohr, the Executive Director of the Society of Automotive Historians, told us that the cars in this picture were not available in 1895. Rather, these vehicles were likely manufactured decades later in the late 1920s or early 1930s.\u00a0\u00a0, Mohr, a native of Ohio, told us that he had heard this rumor a number of times but that he had never seen any documentation to prove that this crash took place as described. The crash was possible, according to Mohr, as there were some privately owned automobiles in Ohio at the time, but as the state didn\u2019t start keeping track of registrations until 1908, it\u2019s impossible to tell how many cars were in operation in the state at the time., As private automobiles were quite novel at the time, it\u2019s likely that a car crash in 1895 would\u2019ve made headlines. We found numerous news articles about automobile crashes in the late 1890s and early 1900s, but we\u2019re able to find any reports about the only two cars in Ohio crashing into one another.\u00a0, While we\u2019ve found no evidence to support this curious car crash claim, Ohio is home to a historically significant automobile accident. In 1891, the state saw what may have been the world\u2019s first car crash involving a gasoline powered vehicle. According to Ohio History Central, an Ohio history website run by the historical society Ohio History Connection, the first gas-powered automobile accident took place in 1891 and involved a single-cylinder gasoline automobile and a tree root., In 1891, James William Lambert was involved in the first automobile accident in American history. The accident occurred in Ohio City, Ohio. Lambert\u2019s vehicle, the first single-cylinder gasoline automobile, which was carrying Lambert and James Swoveland, hit a tree root, causing the car to careen out of control and smash into a hitching post. Injuries from this accident were minor. Lambert proceeded to patent over six hundred inventions, mostly affiliated with the automobile industry., An accident in Ireland preceded this crash by more than 20 years, but that crash involved a steam-powered vehicle. The Atlantic reported that an astronomer and naturalist named Mary Ward was the first person to be killed in an automobile accident when she was thrown from her cousin\u2019s vehicle and run over.\u00a0, In August 1869, Mary Ward took a badly needed holiday at her cousin\u2019s castle in the Irish midlands west of Dublin. Ward was an active naturalist and astronomer, working hard to carve out a place for herself in the overwhelmingly male world of Victorian science. She was also raising eight children more or less alone. She needed some rest, and when someone at the castle suggested taking her cousin\u2019s homemade automobile out for a spin, Ward went along., \u2026, In August 1869, when Ward visited her cousin\u2019s castle, someone suggested taking the steam mobile out for a spin, and Ward agreed. There\u2019s no record of who sat where, but four other people piled in as well. The party decided to circle the town green in Birr. According to one witness, the driver was \u201ctraveling at an easy pace\u201d as he approached the turnaround point near Saint Brendan\u2019s Church and rounded a corner., What happened next isn\u2019t clear. Perhaps a wheel hit a rock or a pothole. Perhaps homemade cars in 1869 just didn\u2019t run very smoothly. Regardless, the overcrowded carriage jolted during the turn, and Ward was bucked off. A second later, she hit the ground, and one of the huge iron wheels crushed her., There\u2019s no evidence that the only two cars in the state of Ohio crashed into one another in 1895. So where does this story come from? The closest we could get to \u201cdocumentation\u201d of this event comes from an advertisement for Mobile gasoline that was published in Life Magazine in 1967.\u00a0That ad included a different photograph (one that we have not been able to find a source for) and a single sentence about this alleged 1895 car crash., , This is not historical documentation of a car crash. It\u2019s entirely possible that this anecdote was invented simply as a jumping off point for Mobil to make a somewhat confusing point about car accidents. (The Swedes did not lower car accidents by deciding that \u201clife is sweet\u201d and \u201cthey want to live.\u201d The ad refers to Dagen H, the day Sweden switched from driving on the left-hand side of the road to the right. While this was viewed as a success at the time, car accidents returned to \u201cnormal levels\u201d in the years since the switch.)\u00a0, The claim that the only two cars in Ohio crashed into one another in 1895 is not supported by evidence. This anecdote appears to have originated with a 1967 advertisement and viral versions of this claim employ unrelated photographs of cars too modern for the time.\u00a0, Source:, Associates, d\u2019Oliveira &amp;. \u201cThe Fascinating History of Car Accidents.\u201d Medium, 27 July 2016, https:\/\/medium.com\/@YouMeanBusiness\/the-fascinating-history-of-car-accidents-ac7478e0079e., Flock, Elizabeth. \u201cDagen H: The Day Sweden Switched Sides of the Road (Photo).\u201d Washington Post, 17 Feb. 2012, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/blogpost\/post\/dagen-h-the-day-sweden-switched-sides-of-the-road-photo\/2012\/02\/17\/gIQAOwFVKR_blog.html., Kean, Sam. \u201cThe First Fatal Car Crash.\u201d The Atlantic, 29 Aug. 2019, https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2019\/08\/pioneering-female-scientist-was-first-car-crash-victim\/597037\/., Life Magazine.

There was reason for this ruthlessness, however; for much of its history (the most successful bit, in fact), the Ottoman dynasty flourished\u2014ruling over modern Turkey, the Balkans and most of North Africa and the Middle East\u2014thanks in part to the staggering violence it meted out to the highest and mightiest members of society., Seen from this perspective, it might be argued that the Ottomans\u2019 decline set in early in the 17th century, precisely at the point when they abandoned the policy of ritually murdering a significant proportion of the royal family whenever a sultan died, and substituted the Western notion of simply giving the job to the first-born son instead. Before then, Ottoman succession had been governed by the \u201claw of fratricide\u201d drawn up by Mehmed II in the middle of the 15th century. Under the terms of this remarkable piece of legislation, whichever member of the ruling dynasty succeeded in seizing the throne on the death of the old sultan was not merely permitted, but enjoined, to murder all his brothers (together with any inconvenient uncles and cousins) in order to reduce the risk of subsequent rebellion and civil war. Although it was not invariably applied, Mehmed\u2019s law resulted in the deaths of at least 80 members of the House of Osman over a period of 150 years. These victims included all 19 siblings of Sultan Mehmed III\u2014some of whom were still infants at the breast, but all of whom were strangled with silk handkerchiefs immediately after their brother\u2019s accession in 1595., Osman II: death by crushed testicles. Image: Wikicommons., For all its deficiencies, the law of fratricide ensured that the most ruthless of the available princes generally ascended to the throne. That was more than could be said of its replacement, the policy of locking up unwanted siblings in the kafes (\u201ccage\u201d), a suite of rooms deep within the Topkapi palace in Istanbul. From around 1600, generations of Ottoman royals were kept imprisoned there until they were needed, sometimes several decades later, consoled in the meantime by barren concubines and permitted only a strictly limited range of recreations, the chief of which was macram\u00e9. This, the later history of the empire amply demonstrated, was not ideal preparation for the pressures of ruling one of the greatest states the world has ever known.For many years, the Topkapi itself paid mute testimony to the grand extent of Ottoman ruthlessness. In order to enter the palace, visitors had first to pass through the Imperial Gate, on either side of which were two niches where the heads of recently executed criminals were always on display. Inside the gate stood the First Court, through which all visitors to the inner portions of the palace had to pass. This court was open to all the sultan\u2019s subjects, and it seethed with an indescribable mass of humanity. Any Turk had the right to petition for redress of his grievances, and several hundred agitated citizens usually surrounded the kiosks at which harassed scribes took down their complaints. Elsewhere within the same court stood numerous armories and magazines, the buildings of the imperial mint and stables for 3,000 horses. The focal point, however, was a pair of \u201cexample stones\u201d positioned directly outside the Central Gate, which led to the Second Court. These \u201cstones\u201d were actually marble pillars on which were placed the severed heads of notables who had somehow offended the sultan, stuffed with cotton if they had once been viziers or with straw if they had been lesser men. Reminders of the sporadic mass executions ordered by the sultan were occasionally piled up by the Central Gate as additional warnings: severed noses, ears and tongues., Selim the Grim. Image: Wikicommons., Capital punishment was so common in the Ottoman Empire that there was a Fountain of Execution in the First Court, where the chief executioner and his assistant went to wash their hands after decapitating their victims\u2014ritual strangulation being reserved for members of the royal family and their most senior officials. This fountain \u201cwas the most feared symbol of the arbitrary power of life and death of the sultans over their subjects, and was hated and feared accordingly,\u201d the historian Barnette Miller wrote. It was used with particular frequency during the reign of Sultan Selim I\u2014Selim the Grim (1512-20)\u2014who, in a reign of eight short years, went through seven grand viziers (the Ottoman title for a chief minister) and ordered 30,000 executions. So perilous was the position of vizier in those dark days that holders of the office were said not to leave their homes in the morning without tucking their wills inside their robes; for centuries afterward, Miller points out, one of the most common curses uttered in the Ottoman Empire was \u201cMays\u2019t thou be vizier to Sultan Selim!\u201d, Given the escalating demands of the executioner\u2019s job, it seems remarkable that the Turks employed no specialist headsman to tackle the endless round of loppings, but they did not. The job of executioner was held instead by the Sultan\u2019s bostanc\u0131 basha, or head gardener\u2014the Ottoman corps of gardeners being a sort of 5,000-strong bodyguard that, aside from cultivating the Sultan\u2019s paradise gardens, doubled up as customs inspectors and police officers. It was the royal gardeners who sewed condemned women into weighted sacks and dropped them into the Bosphorus\u2014it is said that another Sultan, Ibrahim the Mad (1640-48), once had all 280 of the women in his harem executed this way simply so he could have the pleasure of selecting their successors\u2014and the tread of an approaching group of bostanc\u0131s, wearing their traditional uniform of red skull caps, muslin breeches and shirts cut low to expose muscular chests and arms, heralded death by strangulation or decapitation for many thousands of Ottoman subjects down the years., A bostanc\u0131, or member of the Ottoman corps of gardener-executioners. The artist, a European who worked from travelers' accounts, has incorrectly shown him wearing a fez rather than the traditional skull cap., When very senior officials were sentenced to death, they would be dealt with by the bostanc\u0131 basha in person, but\u2014at least toward the end of the sultans\u2019 rule\u2014execution was not the inevitable result of a death sentence. Instead, the condemned man and the bostanc\u0131 basha took part in what was surely one of the most peculiar customs known to history: a race held between the head gardener and his anticipated victim, the result of which was, quite literally, a matter of life or death for the trembling grand vizier or chief eunuch required to undertake it., How this custom came about remains unknown. From the end of the eighteenth century, however, accounts of the bizarre race began to emerge from the seraglio, and these seem reasonably consistent in their details. Death sentences passed within the walls of the Topkapi were generally delivered to the head gardener at the Central Gate; and Godfrey Goodwin describes the next part of the ritual thus:, It was the bostanciba\u015fi\u2018s duty to summon any notable.\u2026 When the vezir or other unfortunate miscreant arrived, he well knew why he had been summoned, but he had to bite his lip through the courtesies of hospitality before, at long last, being handed a cup of sherbet. If it were white, he sighed with relief, but if it were red he was in despair, because red was the color of death., For most of the bostanc\u0131s\u2019 victims, the sentence was carried out immediately after the serving of the fatal sherbet by a group of five muscular young janissaries, members of the sultan\u2019s elite infantry. For a grand vizier, however, there was still a chance: as soon as the death sentence was passed, the condemned man would be allowed to run as fast as he was able the 300 yards or so from the palace, through the gardens, and down to the Fish Market Gate on the southern side of the palace complex, overlooking the Bosphorus, which was the appointed place of execution. (On the map below, which you can view in higher resolution by double clicking on it, the Central Gate is number 109 and the Fish Market Gate number 115.), A plan of the vast Topkapi Palace complex in Istanbul, from Miller's Beyond the Sublime Porte. Click to view in higher resolution., If the deposed vizier reached the Fish Market Gate before the head gardener, his sentence was commuted to mere banishment. But if the condemned man found the bostanci basha waiting for him at the gate, he was summarily executed and his body hurled into the sea., Ottoman records show that the strange custom of the fatal race lasted into the early years of the nineteenth century. The last man to save his neck by winning the life-or-death sprint was the Grand Vizier Hac\u0131 Salih Pasha, in November 1822. Hac\u0131\u2014whose predecessor had lasted a mere nine days in office before his own execution\u2014not only survived his death sentence, but was so widely esteemed for winning his race that he went on to be appointed governor general of the province of Damascus., After that, though, the custom languished, along with the empire itself. The Ottomans barely saw out the 19th century, and when the Turkish state revived, in the 1920s under Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, it did so by turning its back on almost everything the old empire had stood for., Sources, Anthony Alderson.

By precisely undoing the motions in the reverse direction, the ink becomes unmixed! The demonstration seems to defy thermodynamics in that it appears that entropy decreases, but in actuality the reversible mixing is made possible by ensuring that the mixing\/unmixing is done without turbulence., The space between two transparent and concentric cylinders is filled with a viscous fluid (glycerine or Karo\u2122 syrup). One or more lines of colored fluid are also injected into this fluid reservoir, parallel to the axis of the cylinder(s). When the inside cylinder is slowly rotated (by means of a crank) with respect to the outside cylinder, the lines of colored fluid become mixed with the rest of the fluid. Several revolutions renders the mixture completely clear and \"mixed\". If one now reverses the direction of rotation, the colored fluid lines reappear by \"unmixing\" after the same number of rotations in the opposite sense.The design and operation of the apparatus ensures laminar flow. Diffusion processes are, of course, much much slower than the time scale of the demonstration. As one cylinder is rotated w.r.t. the other, one can simply think of layers of fluid being displaced without involving turbulence, the boundary layer next to the inner rotating cylinder being displaced the most and the layer adjacent to the outside cylinder the least. Counter rotation slips these layers back into place., The fluid should be of high viscosity. We have used glycerine or corn syrup. The apparatus capacity is 2.2 to 2.3 liters; thus about 5 bottles of Light Corn Syrup should suffice. It will be necessary to add some kind of preservative 1 to the corn syrup if you plan to leave it in the apparatus for extended periods. Mold does not grow in the glycerine, but glycerine costs about $50\/gallon.The \"ink\" should have similar viscosity to the fluid you use. A few drops of food coloring mixed into about 10 ml of fluid works well. A vertical \"line\" of colored fluid is squirted into the apparatus by means of a hypodermic syringe fitted with a large needle and long stainless-steel extension tube. Alternatively, a 5 ml volumetric pipette fitted with a pipette rubber squeeze-bulb also works well. After the demonstration, the dye can be thoroughly mixed (by a few dozen turns) so that the syrup (or glycerine) can be used again. This will give you many uses before you have to discard it., , The demonstration is quite dramatic. Using different colors for each of the injected lines adds to the visual appeal. The presentation of this demonstration can be further enhanced by first squirting some food coloring into a large beaker of water and stirring the mixture (with a spoon) until a uniform color is achieved. This provides not only a visual contrast for the mixing\/unmixing demo but also a source for further discussion.The demonstration can also be used as a mechanical analog of spin echoes in nuclear magnetic resonance.As far as we know, the original demonstration is due to John P. Heller of Socony Mobil Oil Co. 2 Our present apparatus was fabricated by Harvard student Alyn Kelly ('90) who actually made one for each of the sixteen NECUSE 3 institutions! Many thanks.

Despite representing only about 12-15% of all breast cancers, triple-negative breast cancer accounts for a disproportionately higher percentage of breast cancer deaths and has a higher rate of recurrence. This form of breast cancer is twice as likely to occur in African-American women, and approximately 70% to 80% of the breast tumors that occur in women with mutations in the BRCA1 genes are triple-negative breast cancer., Pharmacy research technican Brenda Flenoy demonstrates a mock preparation of the new breast cancer vaccine in the pharmacy of the basement of the Taussig Cancer Center on Monday, Oct. 25, 2021. (Photo by Lisa DeJong\/Cleveland Clinic), \u201cThis vaccine approach represents a potential new way to control breast cancer,\u201d said Vincent Tuohy, Ph.D., the primary inventor of the vaccine and staff immunologist at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Lerner Research Institute. \u201cThe long-term objective of this research is to determine if this vaccine can prevent breast cancer before it occurs, particularly the more aggressive forms of this disease that predominate in high-risk women.\u201d Dr. Tuohy is named as inventor on the technology, which Cleveland Clinic exclusively licensed to Anixa Biosciences, Inc. He will receive a portion of commercialization revenues received by Cleveland Clinic for this technology and also holds personal equity in the company., The investigational vaccine targets a breast-specific lactation protein, \u03b1-lactalbumin, which is no longer found post-lactation in normal, aging tissues but is present in the majority of triple-negative breast cancers. Activating the immune system against this \u201cretired\u201d protein provides pre-emptive immune protection against emerging breast tumors that express \u03b1-lactalbumin. The vaccine also contains an adjuvant that activates an innate immune response that allows the immune system to mount a response against emerging tumors to prevent them from growing., The study is based on pre-clinical research led by Dr. Tuohy that showed that activating the immune system against the \u03b1-lactalbumin protein was safe and effective in preventing breast tumors in mice. The research also found that a single vaccination could prevent breast tumors from occurring in mouse models, while also inhibiting the growth of already existing breast tumors. The research, originally published in Nature Medicine, was funded in part by philanthropic gifts from more than 20,000 people over the last 12 years., To view or download the animation, click on the image., Funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, the new study at Cleveland Clinic will include 18 to 24 patients who have completed treatment for early-stage triple-negative breast cancer within the past three years and are currently tumor-free but at high risk for recurrence. During the course of the study, participants will receive three vaccinations, each two weeks apart and will be closely monitored for side effects and immune response. The study is estimated to be completed in September 2022., Researchers anticipate that a subsequent trial will involve healthy, cancer-free women at high risk for developing breast cancer who have decided to undergo voluntary bilateral mastectomy to lower their risk. Typically, those women carry mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene and are therefore at risk of developing triple-negative breast cancer or have high familial risk for any form of breast cancer., \u201cThis vaccine strategy has the potential to be applied to other tumor types,\u201d added Dr. Tuohy. \u201cOur translational research program focuses on developing vaccines that prevent diseases we confront with age, like breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers.\u00a0If successful, these vaccines have the potential to transform the way we control adult-onset cancers and enhance life expectancy in a manner similar to the impact that the childhood vaccination program has had.\u201d, About Cleveland ClinicCleveland Clinic \u2013 now in its centennial year \u2013 is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education.

The cage was intended to trap the undead just in case the corpse reanimated.\u201d, Interestingly enough, structures like these, called \u201cmortsafes,\u201d can indeed be found in old graveyards around the U.K., and do date from the early Victorian era. However, they were not designed to keep the \u201cundead\u201d in; they were meant to keep the living out. Grave robbing was a serious problem in the early 1800s, and these sturdy cages were one method people came up with to protect burial sites from disturbance (another was covering the graves with heavy stone slabs).\u00a0, Mortsafes were a Scottish innovation, which is unsurprising given that Edinburgh was a major hub of anatomical study during this period and it was difficult, due to antiquated laws, for researchers to maintain a sufficient supply of medical cadavers. That, in turn, led to a thriving illegal trade popularly known as \u201cbody snatching.\u201d An 1896 article in The Hospital, a British medical journal, looked back on that time:\u00a0, It is now more than sixty years since the Anatomy Act was passed, and there are probably few who remember, except as a tradition, the horrors of the preceding time, when the medical schools were supplied with subjects for dissection chiefly by men who stole corpses from the grave. These men were called body-snatchers, or, in a slang phrase, \u201cresurrection men.\u201d Respect for the dead made the idea of this violation of the grave horrible to the survivors, and various means were devised to secure that the bodies of the beloved dead should remain undisturbed. The iron coffin, instead of the usual wooden one, was so intended. A heavy iron cage, called a \u201cmortsafe,\u201d was another. Mortsafes were of various kinds. Some formed almost a house of iron bars, with a locked gate to it. Others lay flat on the grave, and consisted sometimes entirely of iron, and sometimes of a border of strong masonry with iron bars on the top., The Anatomy Act of 1828 provided for the licensing of teachers of anatomy and set standards for the legal donation of bodies for dissection, effectively eliminating the market for stolen corpses.\u00a0, As for vampires and zombies, there is scant evidence that the Victorians, as a whole, lived in terror of \u201cundead\u201d creatures escaping from the grave. Similar to today, most people understood vampires to be creatures of folklore and fiction. A few well-read Europeans of the time may have been aware of tales about the existence of \u201czombies\u201d via reports of travelers to the Caribbean, but unlike the crazed, cannibalistic \u201cwalking dead\u201d we know today in popular films and TV series, zombies as described in Haitian folklore were dead people reanimated in Vodou (\u201cVoodoo\u201d) rituals and forced to serve as slaves.

Trump has described the fatal shooting as a \u201ctragic accident,\u201d amid claims that the firearm in question was not thoroughly checked to ensure it did not contain live rounds before it was given to Baldwin on set.\u00a0, In the widely shared statement attributed to Trump and dated Oct. 27, the former president appeared to mock Baldwin and gloat over the shooting, telling the actor \u201cNow you\u2019re going to prison\u201d:, A great president (me) once said \u201cI could shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters.\u201d Now Alec Baldwin, a total loser, has taken his impression of me to a new low by testing out this theory. Alec, you aren\u2019t me! Now you\u2019re going to prison, as you should have because of that awful, terrible job you did on SNL (which I have hosted)., , The statement strongly appears to have been a fabrication, and not one actually issued by Trump himself. However, we have not yet found evidence that definitively establishes it was bogus, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it was posted on Trump\u2019s website, before quickly being deleted. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \u201cUnproven.\u201d If relevant evidence becomes available, we will update this fact check accordingly.\u00a0, Like many of Trump\u2019s actual statements, which are posted to DonaldJTrump.com, the screenshot contained a \u201cSave America\u201d logo and bore the headline \u201cStatement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America.\u201d Those features no doubt gave many social media users the impression it was authentic.\u00a0, However, several factors strongly suggest it was not., Firstly, as of Oct. 29, the statement was not available on the \u201cNews\u201d section of Trump\u2019s website where his public pronouncements reside since his suspensions from Twitter and Facebook. Furthermore, archived versions of that page from Oct. 28 do not contain the statement either., This undermines the hypothesis that the statement was deleted after being posted, but not fatally so. It is possible, in theory, that the statement was posted and then quickly deleted during a short window of time on Oct. 27, and therefore not captured in archived versions of the \u201cNews\u201d section.\u00a0, Secondly, we did not find any social media posts that contained a link to the Baldwin statement, even though each of the statements posted to Trump\u2019s website has its own link. Where screenshots of web posts \u2014 for example social media posts or news articles \u2014 are shared widely, but the original web post itself is not, this is often a sign that the screenshots are likely bogus.\u00a0, Thirdly, the date format in the Baldwin screenshot \u2014 MONTH DD, YYYY \u2014 did not match the one used uniformly on Trump\u2019s own website \u2014 MM\/DD\/YY \u2014 and did not contain social media sharing widgets, which are also a ubiquitous feature of Trump\u2019s authentic statements., Though it is possible, in theory, that those responsible for posting the Baldwin message temporarily deviated from the standard date format and temporarily omitted social media sharing widgets, it is unlikely, especially because statements dated after Oct. 27 again used the MM\/DD\/YY format and contained the widgets:, , The statement was therefore highly likely to have been a fabrication. However, we have not yet found definitive evidence to establish that, and cannot yet rule out the possibility that, although unlikely, the statement was posted in an unusual format, before being quickly deleted. For now, our rating is \u201cUnproven.\u201d, Sources:, \u201cHow It Happened: Inside Movie Set Where Baldwin\u2019s Gun Fired.\u201d AP NEWS, 28 Oct. 2021, https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/prop-gun-shooting-entertainment-shootings-movies-santa-fe-4a8e63727b0824d7a402f731b6ec54ea., Company, Navigate, Sections, Account, \u00a9 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc., This material may not be reproduced without permission., Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"},{"content":"In October 2021, several news outlets reported that police New York City police (NYPD) had arrested an actor who once appeared in the popular NBC sitcom \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d in connection with an incident in which a vandal threw paint over a George Floyd statue.\u00a0, For example, on Oct. 27, People magazine published an article with the headline \u201cFormer\u00a0Parks and Recreation\u00a0Actor Arrested for Allegedly Vandalizing George Floyd Statue in N.Y.C.\u201d The story asserted that:, A former Parks and Recreation actor was arrested earlier this month for allegedly vandalizing a statue of George Floyd in New York City. Micah Beals, 37, has been charged with second-degree criminal mischief, the New York Police Department\u2019s Hate Crimes division wrote on Twitter Monday., Beals allegedly rode by the statue on a skateboard and threw gray paint on its face and base on the morning of Oct. 3, police said\u2026As an actor, Beals is known under his stage name: Micah Femia. He has appeared in one episode of Parks and Recreation, as well as an episode of CSI: NY., Several factors point towards \u201cMicah Femia,\u201d an erstwhile actor who once had a small part in an episode of \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d being one and the same person as \u201cMicah Beals,\u201d whom police arrested in New York in October 2021, in connection with the defacement of a Floyd statue., However, despite extensive research, we have not yet been able to definitively establish that link. Although apparently unlikely, we can\u2019t yet rule out the possibility that the man charged in connection with the defacement of the statue was a different person from the actor. As a result, we are designating this fact check as \u201cResearch in Progress.\u201d If and when relevant evidence becomes available, we will update this fact check accordingly.\u00a0, According to New York state court records and the NYPD, a \u201cMicah J. Beals\u201d was arrested in the city on Oct. 25 on suspicion of second-degree criminal mischief in connection with the defacement of the Floyd statue in Union Square Park on Oct. 3. Court records show that Beals, whose year of birth is listed as 1984, was released on recognizance \u2014 that is, released without bail \u2014 after his arrest.\u00a0, According to New York state law, second-degree criminal mischief is a Class D felony that carries a potential maximum prison sentence of seven years.\u00a0, The Internet Movie Database (IMDB) profile for \u201cMicah Femia\u201d states that he was \u201cborn as Micah Joel Beals,\u201d which would give him the same middle initial, \u201cJ,\u201d as the individual arrested in New York on Oct. 25., On the website of \u201cNew York Nuggets,\u201d where Femia advertised his services as a skateboard instructor and arts tutor for children, he described himself as having been \u201cborn and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\u201d, In 2011, Femia played the part of \u201cLen,\u201d a nightclub-goer, during Season 3, Episode 13 of \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Fight\u201d:\u00a0, , In the credits for that episode, his name was listed as \u201cMicah Beals\u201d:, , In October 2016, Femia claimed a $5,000 reward offered by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for holding a sign that read \u201cBill Clinton is a rapist,\u201d while standing in the crowd at Rockefeller Center during the filming of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show:, , In a subsequent appearance on Jones\u2019 Infowars platform, Femia expressed ardent support for then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, described then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as \u201cpure evil,\u201d and expressed gratitude to god for \u201cworking through\u201d Jones and using him as \u201ca vessel.\u201d, , New York state court records also show that a \u201cMicah J. Beals,\u201d also with a birth year of 1984, was arrested in the early hours of Oct. 26, on suspicion of violating Section 265.02.08 of the New York Penal Code, which prohibits the possession of a \u201clarge capacity ammunition feeding device.\u201d An NYPD spokesperson told Snopes that officers recovered from Beals\u2019 possession a .22-caliber rifle, a high-capacity ammunition feeding device, and ammunition., Third-degree criminal possession of a weapon \u2014 of which Beals faces two counts \u2014 is a Class D felony, with a maximum potential sentence of seven years in prison.\u00a0, According to the New York City Department of Correction (DOC), Beals was held at the Eric M. Taylor Center in East Elmhurst, Queens, on Oct. 26, and remained there as of Oct. 28. His \u201cnativity\u201d was listed as \u201cMichigan\u201d \u2014 the same home state as Femia:, , The \u201cMicah J. Beals\u201d arrested in relation to the Floyd statue incident appears to be the same person later arrested on weapons charges. However, we have not yet been able to definitively establish that, despite requesting clarification from the NYPD.\u00a0, As a policy, neither the NYPD nor the NYC DOC provides arrest photos, so it has not yet been possible to conduct a visual comparison between the \u201cMicah Femia\u201d who appeared on the television show in 2011 and was interviewed by Infowars in 2016, and the \u201cMicah J. Beals\u201d arrested in October 2021.\u00a0, We asked both the NYPD and DOC whether they were aware of \u201cMicah J.

However, studies have repeatedly shown that undocumented immigrants actually commit crimes, including violent crimes, at a lower rate than native-born U.S. citizens, as we have outlined in greater detail previously., The day after Trump\u2019s tweet, the conservative \u201cConstitution Club\u201d Facebook page posted a widely-shared meme featuring a photograph of an elderly Nevada couple alleged to have been killed by the \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d in question:, \u201cREST IN PEACE: Gerold sic (81) and Sharon David (80), shot and killed by an illegal immigrant during a home invasion\/robbery in Reno on 1\/10\/19.\u201d, In October 2021, nearly three years after this fact check was originally published, Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman pleaded guilty to several charges, including the murders of Gerald and Sharon David, just as the meme claimed. Federal immigration officials confirmed for Snopes that Martinez-Guzman is an unauthorized immigrant in the United States. As a result, we have changed the rating on this fact check from \u201cUnproven\u201d to \u201cTrue.\u201d, On Jan. 19, 2019, the Carson City Sheriff\u2019s Office arrested Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman, a citizen of El Salvador, in connection with a series of burglaries and homicides in Washoe and Douglas Counties in January 2019. Initial police statements described the suspect as being 19 years old, but Carson City Sheriff\u2019s Office records list his age as 20., Martinez-Guzman was suspected of being responsible for the shooting deaths of 56-year-old Connie Koontz on Jan. 10, 2019, 74-year-old Sophia Renken on Jan. 13, and Gerald David (81) and his wife Sharon David (80) on Jan. 16., A spokesperson for the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) confirmed to Snopes that Martinez-Guzman is an undocumented immigrant, writing in an email to us that: \u201cMr. Martinez-Guzman is a citizen of El Salvador who entered the United States unlawfully on an unknown date and location. He has no prior criminal or immigration history. ICE has lodged a detainer.\u201d, ICE files a detainer request with a local law enforcement agency when they have reason to believe that an individual is eligible to be deported from the United States, and ICE formally asks that agency to notify ICE in advance of the individual\u2019s release from custody (for example, after serving a prison sentence) so that ICE can then immediately take the person into custody and begin the deportation process., Martinez-Guzman was initially charged in Carson City with burglary and possession of stolen property in relation to his alleged actions at the David household in South Reno, as well as immigration offences. At the time this fact check was originally published, in January 2019, he had not been charged with murder, but local law enforcement officials said they were \u201cconfident they have evidence that will link him to all four homicides.\u201d, On Jan. 24, 2019, the Carson City District Attorney added several additional charges.

Two large Caravans from Honduras broke into Mexico and are headed our way. We need a powerful Wall!, \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 21, 2019, , President Trump and some of his supporters have consistently talked up the supposed risk to public safety from immigration across the southern U.S. border. However, studies have repeatedly shown that undocumented immigrants actually commit crimes, including violent crimes, at a lower rate than native-born U.S. citizens, as we have outlined in greater detail previously., The day after Trump\u2019s tweet, the conservative \u201cConstitution Club\u201d Facebook page posted a widely-shared meme featuring a photograph of an elderly Nevada couple alleged to have been killed by the \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d in question:, \u201cREST IN PEACE: Gerold sic (81) and Sharon David (80), shot and killed by an illegal immigrant during a home invasion\/robbery in Reno on 1\/10\/19.\u201d, In October 2021, nearly three years after this fact check was originally published, Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman pleaded guilty to several charges, including the murders of Gerald and Sharon David, just as the meme claimed. Federal immigration officials confirmed for Snopes that Martinez-Guzman is an unauthorized immigrant in the United States. As a result, we have changed the rating on this fact check from \u201cUnproven\u201d to \u201cTrue.\u201d, On Jan. 19, 2019, the Carson City Sheriff\u2019s Office arrested Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman, a citizen of El Salvador, in connection with a series of burglaries and homicides in Washoe and Douglas Counties in January 2019. Initial police statements described the suspect as being 19 years old, but Carson City Sheriff\u2019s Office records list his age as 20., Martinez-Guzman was suspected of being responsible for the shooting deaths of 56-year-old Connie Koontz on Jan. 10, 2019, 74-year-old Sophia Renken on Jan. 13, and Gerald David (81) and his wife Sharon David (80) on Jan. 16., A spokesperson for the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) confirmed to Snopes that Martinez-Guzman is an undocumented immigrant, writing in an email to us that: \u201cMr. Martinez-Guzman is a citizen of El Salvador who entered the United States unlawfully on an unknown date and location. He has no prior criminal or immigration history. ICE has lodged a detainer.\u201d, ICE files a detainer request with a local law enforcement agency when they have reason to believe that an individual is eligible to be deported from the United States, and ICE formally asks that agency to notify ICE in advance of the individual\u2019s release from custody (for example, after serving a prison sentence) so that ICE can then immediately take the person into custody and begin the deportation process., Martinez-Guzman was initially charged in Carson City with burglary and possession of stolen property in relation to his alleged actions at the David household in South Reno, as well as immigration offences. At the time this fact check was originally published, in January 2019, he had not been charged with murder, but local law enforcement officials said they were \u201cconfident they have evidence that will link him to all four homicides.\u201d, On Jan. 24, 2019, the Carson City District Attorney added several additional charges. According to KOLO-TV, those new charges included:, On Oct. 21, 2021, after a series of delays, Martinez-Guzman pleaded guilty to several charges against him in Washoe County, Nevada, including the murders of Gerald and Sharon David.

They searched until 3 a.m., then called off the search for the night, returning at 7 a.m. the following day to search another area., Lake County Search and Rescue stated:, The subject stated they\u2019d lost the trail around nightfall and spent the night searching for the trail, and once on the trail, bounced around onto different trails trying to locate the proper trailhead, finally reaching their car the next morning, approximately 24 hours after they\u2019d started their hike. They had no idea that SAR was out looking for them., One notable take-away is that the subject ignored repeated phone calls from us because they didn\u2019t recognize the number. If you\u2019re overdue according to your itinerary, and you start getting repeated calls from an unknown number, please answer the phone; it may be a SAR team trying to confirm you\u2019re safe!, The rescue organization didn\u2019t identify the hiker in question, but added the following comment in response to Facebook users who got a little out of control in the comments:, Please remember that what seems like common sense in hindsight is not obvious to a subject in the moment when they are lost and panicking. In Colorado, most folks who spend time outdoors have a good understanding of the SAR infrastructure that is there to help them, but this is not the case nation-wide. Please keep your comments respectful., The hiker made it back to safety, but not before spending 24 hours exposed to the elements.

It was retweeted and liked tens of thousands of times., However, there is no evidence that Ivey appeared in this picture.

It does seem that we have blinders on sometimes. Honestly, the United States has so much and dominates so much culture it isn\u2019t very hard to think that this is all there is. Exploring both historical and modern maps can bring the rest of the world into focus. Exploring map based infographics can be very enlightening as you try to understand relationships between all parts of the globe., I had the pleasure of taking a cruise around the Mediterranean a few years ago.\u00a0My wife and I had such a great time exploring the historical places and artifacts and\u00a0the life of strange cities. I thought, wouldn\u2019t it be great\u00a0if the Mediterranean wasn\u2019t so far away?, Well, I was examining maps and globes and realized that the Mediterranean Sea\u00a0is at the same Latitude as the United States.\u00a0If only it\u00a0were possible to rotate the Mediterranean Sea around to our side of the planet? Would it fit? What effect would this have? What about the states\u2026 new coastlines in the middle of the country\u2026 new relationships\u2026 states torn in pieces?, A couple of screen captures, lots of graphic manipulation and now we know.\u00a0The Mediterranean Sea fits within the confines of the United States of America. In a way, it is pretty amazing how big the Mediterranean Sea is.\u00a0 We always think if the United States as a vast country, more than 3000 miles\u00a0from east coast to west coast. It\u00a0used to be quite a task to traverse that distance.\u00a0Amazingly, ancient mariners of the Mediterranean\u00a0traversed similar vast areas of water for their commerce, and conquests., So, what have we done? This is a new vision of the United States of America. A few states have been unaffected by this mash-up.\u00a0 Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Main and Florida.\u00a0Yes, I am ignoring Alaska and Hawaii since they are remote, sorry., It\u2019s interesting to note that by adding the Black Sea, it nicely takes the place of our own Great Lakes. The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec get new coastlines, but Lower Ontario becomes an isolated piece on the US side. A Canadian interloper if you will.\u00a0Although the Great Lakes are very large, I believe the\u00a0area of the Black Sea is larger than the combined Great Lakes. In this alternate US the remaining areas of the Great Lakes become great grassy plains\u2026 perhaps, International Park Reserves, or snatched up by neighboring states.\u00a0Michigan loses a large portion of its \u201cmitten\u201d and the upper peninsula becomes the state it always wanted to be, Superior., The \u201crust belt\u201d area of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania would approximate the area of Turkey.\u00a0Illinois becomes a state of great island outcroppings and the \u201cAegean Sea\u201d becomes the \u201cIllinois Sea\u201d. Kentucky hugs the southern coastline of the new \u201crust belt\u201d. The Greek Islands of Karpathos and Rhodes would be part of Kentucky. What a history to explore., The South has been largely supplanted by the \u201cConfederate Sea\u201d, the eastern arm of the Mediterranean. The southern states have been effectively\u00a0cut in half. Oddly, mirroring the Turkish grab of part of the Island of Cyprus, West Virginia has grabbed a part of this alternate Cyprus that is mostly in Virginia. The State of Tennessee has been reduced to a portion of the former Island of Crete., Missouri would take most of the Greek peninsula, the Peloponnese, most of Crete,\u00a0and many islands. Iowa gains great rocky coastlines on both the east and west.\u00a0The new \u201cPlains Sea\u201d, that\u00a0takes the place of the former \u201cAdriatic Sea\u201d, reaches into North Dakota and cuts South Dakota into the new states of\u00a0East Dakota and West Dakota. West Dakota is the new Tuscany and East Dakota approximates Croatia.\u00a0Nebraska is now the main \u201cboot\u201d of Italy with coast on the east and west.\u00a0Kansas takes over the \u201ctoe\u201d of Italy\u00a0and Sicily (except Colorado has made a foothold on the west tip)., The \u201cTyrrhenian Sea\u201d along the west coast of the Italian peninsula becomes the \u201cNebraska Sea\u201d and reaches all the way up to Montana and the Custer\u2019s Battlefield Monument.\u00a0 Wyoming has split into the new state of Yellowstone (with the\u00a0amazing Yellowstone Park)\u00a0and the Wyoming Islands (Corsica and the Northern part of Sardinia). Idaho gains new coastline., Texas, New Mexico and Colorado have a great new coastline.\u00a0Although Colorado has been mostly swallowed up and\u00a0maintains the southern\u00a0part of Sardinia and an outpost on Sicily., Utah has split into the coastal area along the northern edge of Arizona and the Great Salt Islands.\u00a0Nevada has lost the southern portion to a new state called Las Vegas.\u00a0In return they\u00a0get a Mediterranean coastline. I think that would be a good trade.\u00a0, The new \u201cSea of California\u201d, the western outlet,\u00a0splits the state into Northern California and Southern California\u2026 most Californians want that anyway. This leads us to the \u201cStrait of Pismo\u201d and out to the Pacific Ocean.\u00a0There just may be a \u201cRock of Pismo\u201d in place of the \u201cRock of Gibraltar\u201d.\u00a0Not quite the cache\u2019\u2026 I would say., So, a brave new alternate United States of America with its great inland sea.\u00a0What a different world it might have been, or might be in another alternate world.

(Jim Weber\/Santa Fe New Mexican via AP), Actor Alec Baldwin was practicing removing a revolver from its holster and aiming toward the camera during rehearsal for the movie \u201cRust\u201d when director Joel Souza heard \u201cwhat sounded like a whip and then a loud pop,\u201d according to a search warrant that provided grim new details about the final minutes of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins\u2019 life., In the newly released document obtained by the Los Angeles Times on Sunday night, Souza said the weapon had been described to him as a \u201ccold gun,\u201d meaning it did not have any live rounds. But the gun discharged, striking Hutchins in her chest and Souza in his right shoulder, according to a Santa Fe County, N.M., sheriff\u2019s detective\u2019s affidavit used to obtain a search warrant. Hutchins was pronounced dead at an Albuquerque hospital. , Souza\u2019s statement to the detective offered a new window into the on-set shooting Thursday that has left Hollywood reeling and calling for safer working conditions on sets. , The shooting took place after six members of the film\u2019s crew walked off the set after complaining to the production company about payment and housing, camera operator Reid Russell told Det. Joel Cano.  Russell\u2019s and Souza\u2019s statements to the detective offered  the most detailed chronology yet of how the tragedy unfolded., , Entertainment &amp; Arts, Everything we know so far about the fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins on the \u2018Rust\u2019 set, Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, one of American Cinematographer\u2019s Rising Stars, was killed on the set of \u2018Rust.\u2019 Here\u2019s everything we know so far., Nov. 7, 2021, The day started late because the production had hired  a replacement camera crew and was working with only one camera, Souza told the detective., Aside from Baldwin, Souza said, two people were handling the gun for the scene: armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed and then assistant director Dave Halls, who handed the gun to Baldwin, the affidavit said. , Because of COVID-19 safety protocols, Gutierrez Reed set up three prop guns on a cart outside Bonanza Creek Ranch\u2019s church set, the focus of the search warrant. Halls did not know live rounds were in the gun that he handed to Baldwin, and Halls yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d according to the affidavit. , Souza  told the detective that cast and crew had been preparing for the scene before lunch but then took a meal break away from the rehearsal area around 12:30 p.m. When they returned, Souza said, he wasn\u2019t sure  whether the gun was checked again. He also addressed the possibility of cast or crew members bringing onto the set live ammunition and live rounds, which can include potentially dangerous blanks., \u201cJoel said as far as he knows, no one gets checked for live ammunition on their person prior and after the scenes are being filmed,\u201d the affidavit said. \u201cThe only thing checked are the firearms to avoid live ammunition being in them. Joel stated there should never be live rounds whatsoever, near or around the scene.\u201d , Movies, Lack of gun safety killed Halyna Hutchins on the set of Alec Baldwin\u2019s \u2018Rust.\u2019 How did this happen?, \u201cWhoever handed the loaded gun to Alec Baldwin should be held responsible to some level.\u201d, Oct. 22, 2021, When they came back from lunch, a creeping shadow prompted the camera to be moved to a different angle, Russell told the detective. As Baldwin was explaining how he was going to draw his gun and where his arm would be positioned,  it discharged, Russell said. , Souza said he was looking over Hutchins\u2019 shoulder when the gun discharged. Hutchins grabbed her midsection, stumbled backward and was assisted to the ground, Souza told the detective., Russell recalled hearing a loud bang, seeing a bloody Souza and hearing Hutchins say she couldn\u2019t feel her legs, the affidavit said. , Crew members called 911 asking for help. Script supervisor Mamie Mitchell expressed frustration that an assistant director yelled at her at lunch and asked about revisions, according to audio from a 911 call obtained by The Times. , \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to check the guns,\u201d Mitchell said on the 911 call. \u201cHe\u2019s responsible for what happens on the set.\u201d, Mitchell told the 911 operator that she could not say whether the gun was loaded with a real bullet., Halls, the first assistant director, did not respond to The Times\u2019 request for comment., Halls has come under scrutiny before., In 2019, he was fired from the film \u201cFreedom\u2019s Path\u201d after a crew member had a minor and temporary injury when a prop gun \u201cunexpectedly discharged,\u201d according to a producer from the film who declined to be named because he was not authorized to comment., That same year, Halls was brought in to replace first assistant director Courtney Hope Therond on the film \u201cThe Pale Door\u201d after she was let go from the job. Therond said the Oklahoma production had many safety issues that she pushed back on, such as no safety plan for tornadoes in a tornado zone. , \u201cThat\u2019s when they brought in Dave because he had a reputation for being lax on safety,\u201d Therond said. \u201cApparently, when the first AD walks off a project, Dave is known as the guy you call.\u201d, , Aaron B. Koontz, whose Paper Street Pictures was the production company on \u201cThe Pale Door,\u201d refuted that Therond was fired because she was overzealous about safety, and said Halls did not replace her because of his supposed relaxed attitude towards safety. , But Koontz did acknowledge that the movie\u2019s unit production manager received safety complaints about Halls during production relating to weather hazards., \u201cDave was frustrated at the amount of time it was taking in between lightning delays,\u201d said Koontz, who also directed the film. \u201cI do remember him growing frustrated, saying, \u2018Hey, the lightning is so far away. We\u2019re good guys, can we go? We need to go.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time, just cause Dave\u2019s a fiery guy.\u201d, On the action thriller \u201cOne Way,\u201d shot in Georgia in February, a camera assistant said Halls did not hold a safety meeting before shooting a dangerous scene involving a Russian Arm, a crane-like piece of equipment that is attached to a high-speed vehicle during filming, and reported her concerns to two producers and a local union representative. Those individuals did not respond to a request for comment from The Times., \u201cHe has this demeanor that it\u2019s almost like he doesn\u2019t take anything seriously,\u201d said first camera assistant Lisa Long, who reported Halls\u2019 behavior. \u201cIt got so bad that I had a meeting with production to tell them he didn\u2019t care about our safety and it wasn\u2019t right. \u201c, Long was surprised when filming began that the highway had not been cleared of outside traffic, especially because it was raining that day.

She grew up on a remote Soviet military base and worked on documentary films in Eastern Europe before studying film in Los Angeles and embarking on a promising movie-making career., Hutchins was shot with a prop gun Thursday on the set of the Western \u201cRust\u201d near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Court records released Friday indicated that an assistant director handed Baldwin a loaded weapon and told him it was safe to use. Detectives were investigating., On her Instagram page, Hutchins identified herself as a \u201crestless dreamer\u201d and \u201cadrenaline junkie.\u201d In recent days, she posted several images from the set, including an early morning shot of a cloudy desert sky, a video of herself riding horseback during a day off and a photo of the crew gathered to express solidarity with union members. The members of the IATSE union were seeking a new contract and threatened to strike before a settlement was reached last weekend., According to her website, she grew up on the Soviet base in the Arctic Circle and was \u201csurrounded by reindeer and nuclear submarines.\u201d She received a graduate degree in international journalism from Kyiv National University in Ukraine, worked on British documentary productions in Eastern Europe and graduated from the American Film Institute Conservatory in 2015. She is survived by her husband, Matthew Hutchins, with whom she had a son., \u201cShe had an interesting background, and I think that made for a unique perspective on the world,\u201d said one of her AFI teachers, Bill Dill. \u201cShe brought a wealth of experience to the movie-making process.\u201d, In a 2019 interview with American Cinematographer, which named her one of the year\u2019s rising stars, she described herself as an \u201carmy brat\u201d drawn to movies because \u201cthere wasn\u2019t that much to do outside.\u201d She would document herself parachuting and exploring caves, among other adventures, and through her work with British filmmakers, became \u201cfascinated with storytelling based on real characters.\u201d, After moving to the U.S., she took any production-assistant work she could find and explored fashion photography to learn more about the \u201caesthetics of lighting \u2014 how you create the mood, the feeling.\u201d In 2013, she was accepted into a two-year program at the AFI Conservatory. The school\u2019s chair of cinematography, remembered her dedication to the craft., \u201cShe was very thoughtful about the decision, and it was not an easy decision. All film schools are expensive and this was not an exception,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were very impressed with her. I remember telling her, \u2018You\u2019re not going to have much time for your family in your first year at AFI.\u2019 And she understood that. She was really working hard.\u201d, Stephen Pizzello, editor-in-chief and publisher of American Cinematographer and a close friend of Hutchins\u2019, said she had not only a \u201cjoyful spirit\u201d but a strong sense of how to network in the movie business. She was \u201ctireless in terms of improving her skills and being in the right places,\u201d a regular at \u201cindustry events and parties.\u201d, \u201cEverybody liked her,\u201d he said., Before \u201cRust,\u201d her credits included the crime drama \u201cBlindfire\u201d and the horror film \u201cDarlin,\u201d whose director, Pollyanna McIntosh, posted on Instagram that she was \u201cthe most talented, in the trenches, committed wonderful artist and team mate.\u201d Director Adam Egypt Mortimer, who worked with her on the 2020 thriller \u201cArchenemy,\u201d said she had a powerful sense of confidence and an inspiring openness to challenges. He remembered a day on the set when an actor had to leave and the rest of the crew had to work around him., \u201cHalyna was excited,\u201d said Mortimer, who recalled her asking if they would shoot the scenes \u201cEuropean style,\u201d meaning that they would improvise., Cinematographer Andriy Semenyuk, a fellow Ukrainian who met Hutchins a few years ago through friends, remembered how she welcomed him and brought him to some of her assignments. He called her a mentor with a \u201cmagnetizing\u201d personality who stood out for her willingness to help others., \u201cI think the big deal about her in general, beyond being extremely talented \u2014 which is a given \u2014 is just her generous and really open personality,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the film industry, which is super competitive, it\u2019s not enough to have talent. It\u2019s good to have this human, appealing personality.\u201d, ___, AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr and AP Entertainment Writer Ryan Pearson in Los Angeles contributed to this report., These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.

We break down all the information currently available here., We should note that we reached out to the Attorney General\u2019s office and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI), which is conducting an independent investigation into the shooting, including verifying who made the two 911 calls that day. A spokesperson for the Attorney General\u2019s office told us that as the investigation is active, they could not give us any information about the phone calls yet., Michael Woods, interim police chief for CPD, said emergency dispatch received a call at 4:32 p.m on April 20. A female caller said other girls were at the home trying to \u201cstab them and put their hands on them,\u201d Woods said. Police officers were dispatched four minutes after the call ended and they arrived at the home at 4:44 p.m., In the first of the two calls that were made public in a press conference (the calls can be heard two minutes into the video below), a woman\u2019s voice can be heard telling the police the address in Columbus, punctuated by shouting. In a second call, seemingly from a different person, the caller hung up after saying the police had already arrived. The police did not tell reporters who made the 911 calls., Paula Bryant, Ma\u2019Khia\u2019s mother, said that her daughter made the 911 call., \u201cMy daughter dispatched Columbus police for protection, not to be a homicide today,\u201d she said., Ma\u2019Khia\u2019s aunt, Hazel Bryant, echoed that sentiment, telling the Ohio Statehouse News Bureau that a group of \u201colder kids\u201d threatened Ma\u2019Khia with assault., In an interview with The Washington Post, Ma\u2019Khia\u2019s grandmother Jeanene Hammonds said that the girl did not call the police to the scene, contradicting earlier claims. She added that it was Bryant\u2019s younger sister, her other granddaughter, who called 911, A woman named Tay Jones, who claimed to have witnessed the shooting, posted a video allegedly from the scene on Facebook. She also claimed that Bryant was the one who made the call to the police. At the 16 minute mark in the video below, she said Bryant was \u201cdefending herself. She called them for help, and I guess she ended up pulling the knife out.\u201d She added that the police officer just shot Bryant, and didn\u2019t even tell her to put the knife down.\u00a0, As of April 21, the police had not established who made the first call., Given that the BCI has not yet released the results of its independent investigation, this story is currently rated a \u201cResearch in Progress.\u201d We will update this when we receive new information., Company, Navigate, Sections, Account, \u00a9 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc., This material may not be reproduced without permission., Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"}]
